Arunabh Roy (CS5), Dinu Goyal (CS5), Maalav Mehta (MT1), Yash Bansal (CS5)
Domain: Research
Interned at CISPA, Germany
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Vaibhav Srivastava, Yuv Verdia
Introduction
Maalav:
Hi, I'm Maalav, a third-year student in Mathematics and Computing. We all interned at CISPA in South Germany. My research internship focused on graph theory and algorithms.
Arunabh:
Hello, I'm Arunabh. I'm also in my third year in the CS5 department. My internship was centred on fuzzing.
Dinu:
Hi, I'm Dinu, and I'm in the CS5 department as well. My internship revolved around distributed algorithms.
Yash:
Hello, I'm Yash. I also interned at CISPA, where I worked on hyperproperties.
Motivation.
Yash:
My main motive was to explore research and experiment with different topics.
Maalav:
When I joined college, I was interested in something proof-based and mathematical. Quant was one option, but I also wanted to explore research.
Arunabh:
Research is challenging to pursue at IIT, so I wanted to experience a proper research internship. Also, since Dinu, Yash, and I are in dual degree courses, we were in a unique position to do a research internship because we have an extra year.
Dinu:
I knew I would do a corporate internship later, so I figured it would be a good idea to try research first.
What led you to choose the specific domain of your internship?
Arunabh:
I was looking for a theoretical computer science research internship. When the CISPA application came up, my friends and I decided to apply to different projects to avoid overlap. I ended up applying for a project related to code testing (a technique called fuzz testing), which was something I had dabbled in before. In your second year, you might not know much and could have preconceived notions about liking or disliking a subject. But when you explore any topic in enough depth, there's something interesting for everyone. So, I‚Äôd advise keeping an open mind.
Maalav:
I was interested in mathematical topics and coding, but finding an internship that matched my interests was challenging. The closest option was theoretical computer science. I applied through CISPA's online program and chose a project related to graph theory, which aligned well with my coursework in discrete maths.
Application Process
What was the application process like?
The application was online and started around October. After submitting the form, professors shortlisted a few candidates, who were then interviewed, typically with questions related to the field you applied for. Their process was slow, and the final acceptance emails came around February.
How should one approach the application procedure?
There are a few approaches:
Mass Mailing:
It‚Äôs about sending out emails to professors, with the first paragraph specific to the professor and the rest highlighting your interest in research. This method is luck-based but can be effective in especially getting remote internships.
Using Resources:
Websites like Chinmay Mittal‚Äôs GitHub page and Yash Aggarwal‚Äôs OneDrive PDF list opportunities. Applying where your seniors were selected and using platforms like CS Rankings can also help. Referrals from friends who may have received multiple offers can be beneficial.
Program Applications:
Programs like EPFL ,CISPA¬† and NUS are well-funded and organised for securing research internships.
OCS Notifications:
The Office of Career Services (OCS) sometimes brings research internship notifications, but it‚Äôs better not to rely solely on them. Like Max Plancks Institute came through it , you can also apply through mail in it .
Yash:
I used Chinmay Mittal‚Äôs GitHub site to find opportunities and applied to CISPA after learning about it from my mentor.
Maalav:
I found out about CISPA through BSP‚Äôs 2nd Year Intern articles :3.
Preparation
Arunabh:
Focus on maintaining a strong CGPA, as it‚Äôs crucial for your CV. Apart from CGPA, you might not have much to showcase initially. Olympiads can be helpful, too, as some professors have a preference for them.
Yash:
I‚Äôve heard that exams like NTSE and KVPY also help since they are well-regarded abroad, especially in academic circles.
Maalav:
It‚Äôs important to demonstrate genuine passion in your application. You can do this by engaging in relevant projects on campus. For example, I enjoyed my economics course in the third semester, so I approached my professor for a project. This experience was valuable in my interview when I discussed it. Also, make sure to thoroughly read about the research of the professor you‚Äôre applying to before the interview.
Arunabh:
Many people list COL assignments as projects, but it‚Äôs better to have something unique. For instance, I built a test-case generator for my COL106 assignment, which was a unique project I could showcase. Interestingly, it was related to fuzzing, my internship topic, so it really helped.
Dinu:
One crucial piece of advice is to never fake anything in your cover letter. Whatever topic or paper you mention, the professor might ask detailed questions about it during the interview.
Internship Experience
Visa Application Advice
Dinu:
Stay proactive and organised. If you face issues with appointments or document submissions, contact the visa office directly instead of relying solely on third parties. Regular follow-ups are essential, as delays can happen. Having a flexible flight ticket is crucial since visa processing can be unpredictable.
Maalav:
Track your document submissions and follow up frequently. Apply for your visa appointment at least 20 days before departure to avoid last-minute issues. Be prepared for random rejections or delays and have a backup plan.
Yash:
Flexible tickets can save you from stress and extra costs. Ensure all your documents are complete and correct to avoid delays. I had to adjust my travel plans due to document issues, so it's essential to be well-prepared.
Work experience
Maalav
: The internship started with the professor giving me an hour-long crash course on distributed algorithms‚Äîit was overwhelming, to say the least. Thankfully, he gave me study materials and helped out when I was lost, although I wish I‚Äôd asked for more help when I got stuck. My project ended up focusing on set theory. The funny part? By the end, there was this one stubborn question we both couldn‚Äôt solve. My professor just said, ‚ÄúNo worries, we‚Äôll save it for the next intern!‚Äù So yeah, my
output
finally was passing on an unsolved problem to the next person :D.
Arunabh
: My professor handed me his own book to study for the first two weeks, and then he left town. So, I spent those weeks deep in that book. My task was to read a research paper and implement its logic in a different way than the code they provided. Sounds simple? Nope. It was seriously tough. Some days, I got nothing. But, out of nowhere, something I had learned in an IITD course I thought I‚Äôd never use turned out to be key. So, here‚Äôs the lesson: study your courses! In the end, my code made it into the professor‚Äôs book, which was pretty awesome. It was a laid-back but very self-motivated experience. My advice? Go with friends and enjoy yourself.
Dinu
: My experience was way different from Arunabh. I had zero clue about the problem my professor gave me‚Äîsomething about Byzantine reliable broadcasting. It took me a whole month just to wrap my head around it. It was completely unexplored territory. Thankfully, my professor was super patient and answered all my questions, even when I was completely lost. By the end, I managed to make progress, and it might even turn into a research paper. So, yeah, it was a slow grind, but it paid off in the end.
Yash
: When I met my professor, he was super excited about publishing a research paper and getting tons of stuff done. The first 15 days were solid; he took updates from me every day. But then, he left for a conference and didn't come back for the rest of my internship. The real kicker? All my co-interns were German, and I didn‚Äôt know a word of German. Most of my time was spent reading research papers I didn‚Äôt fully understand or just hanging out. By the end, I managed to write 100 lines of code for an existing architecture, but here‚Äôs the funny part‚Äîmy professor never even asked for the code back! So yeah, it‚Äôs still sitting with me, unused. Lmao!
Fun Experience
Arunabh:
One of the highlights was the camaraderie among interns. We often spent long lunch breaks at the university canteen, enjoying affordable meals and exploring the campus and nearby parks. These moments made the experience enjoyable despite the rigorous work.
Dinu:
The shared experiences with fellow interns were memorable. We spent a lot of time together, whether enjoying meals or exploring the area around the campus. These moments became more frequent and enjoyable as the internship progressed.
Yash
: We made the most of our weekends by exploring Europe. The flexible work schedule allowed us to plan trips every other weekend, and honestly, those trips remain the highlights of the whole internship! :))
How did the research internship impact your perspective?
Maalav:
I've realised research relies heavily on self-motivation, which is tricky for someone like me. We‚Äôre so used to studying only when quizzes or exams are right around the corner. But in research, progress is more flexible‚Äîevery bit of logical work counts. That‚Äôs a plus, but maybe it‚Äôs just not for me. I still feel like corporate might be the way to go. Although, after getting back to campus with all the quizzes, I sometimes find myself thinking, "Maybe research isn't so bad after all."
Someone:
The grass is always greener on the other side. (Everyone laughs and agrees:))
Arunabh:
My outlook on research has been pretty positive. It was a good experience, and at the very least, I got better at writing Python!
Dinu:
I went in really leaning toward theoretical computer science, but after the internship, I realised it requires a lot¬†of patience. You need to have a deep well of knowledge, and right now, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm cut out for it.
Yash:
Funny enough, the theoretical side actually sparked my interest even more. But when it comes to the practical side of things... yeah, not my cup of tea. Yeah, that part didn‚Äôt really click for me.
How did the stipend and financial aspects play out during your internship?
Everyone:
The stipend offered by CISPA is generous, covering essential expenses and allowing some savings if managed well. It's consistent whether you're from India or any other country. Though living expenses in Germany can vary, especially depending on your proximity to the institute, the stipend generally suffices. It's important to note that the stipend aligns with the minimum wage in Germany, so it's not extravagant but definitely manageable.
What are your final tips for juniors considering a research internship abroad?
Self-motivation is Key:
Research is self-driven. Be prepared to work without clear guidelines, and push yourself to achieve as much as you can.
Don't Hesitate to Ask Questions:
Whether it‚Äôs about the fundamentals or complex topics, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask your professors. They understand that you're still learning, especially if you're in the early years of your academic journey.
Learn to Balance Work and Life:
An internship abroad will teach you how to manage your time effectively, balancing work with personal life. This experience is invaluable for your personal growth.
Financial Management:
The stipend is enough if you budget wisely. Be prepared for varying living expenses, especially if you're in a high-cost area.
Internships Are Not Everything:
Don‚Äôt stress if your internship doesn‚Äôt result in a PPO or if things don‚Äôt go as planned. Internships are just one step in your career, not the ultimate goal.
Broaden Your Horizons:
Living in a different country will expose you to new cultures, people, and ways of thinking. Embrace the experience fully.
Don‚Äôt Overhype Internships:
It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the pressure, but remember, internships are just a part of your learning journey. Focus on what you can learn rather than just the outcome.
Stay Open-Minded:
You might start with certain expectations, but be open to where the experience takes you. It‚Äôs all part of the learning process.
Final Thoughts:
The experience of working in a foreign country, especially in a research-intensive environment, is enriching and offers growth both professionally and personally. While it comes with its challenges, the skills and insights you gain are invaluable. So, embrace the journey and make the most of it!

Motion Planning in Geometric Settings
Interned at INRIA, France
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Umang Badetia
Introduction
I‚Äôm Akshat, currently in my third year of studying in the Computer Science Department. I interned at INRIA in my second year, the internship being based on Motion Planning in Geometric Settings.
Brief Introduction to the Internship Role and His Work
.
Motion Planning Algorithms are applied to general robotics. I tried to take them and apply them to settings in which you need to think about geometrical conformations, and how proteins move. It also involved a bunch of code, which was further added to the Standard Bioinformatics Library that INRIA hosts.
Why a second-year intern, and that too a research intern.
I had seen a lot of seniors following the traditional route of doing a second-year research intern, followed by a third-year corporate intern so that they could check every facet of their list. Of all the available options, INRIA was highly commended by every senior. When I got the acceptance letter from their end, I went through with it.
Domains that he found himself interested in. And why a domain related to biology.
I was open to doing anything; I did not have any interests as such. Every place where I thought I could be a good fit or what a senior recommended to me, I applied there. I did not have any strong and specific interest as such, to be honest.
Metrics to narrow down the domain.
If you want to do a foreign research internship, good reviews about the internship matter a lot. If you are going to do a research internship via a program, some of your seniors probably went to that place as well. Then, if you get a sense of what you are trying to do there (at the research internship) and you feel like you will be a good fit, do you want to do more coding or more mathematical analysis, you should keep these in your mind while making a decision. Also, a thing people don‚Äôt think about a lot, is the ability to manage expenses with the amount of money you have; such minor points should also be considered.
Try talking to a lot of seniors, and talk to more than just a single senior. Some seniors might have gone through the same internship program you are aiming to get into, while you might be close to some other seniors. Do account the amalgamation of their opinions while forming your own opinion. If you are close to some professors, you can also consult them, as they might be familiar with the work happening in any famous lab.
Timeline of the overall process.
Usually, in a research internship, the internship takes a lot of time; you need to be very patient. There are two types of research interns: either it is a program, or you have to send emails (cold-emailing) randomly. For me, the process was pretty quick; I applied right after the minors in my 3rd semester (around 25th Sept) and got my acceptance letter within a week. For INRIA, the application turnaround is usually quick, but it took some time for a few of my friends to get their acceptance letters.
APPLICATION PROCESS
Methodology for approaching the intern.
I was a bit uniquely situated in this aspect because I know a lot of seniors from IITD who had worked in the same labs/centres in INRIA as me, so the people in INRIA share a positive review of the students of IITD. The professor that I had approached was in touch with the previous interns (our seniors). We had sent in the emails right when he anticipated the same from us, so the timelines matched, luckily.
There are a lot of other programs as well; I received another response from a professor at Yale. I had constantly bugged him by emailing him (don‚Äôt do that), but by the time he replied positively, I was already accepted in INRIA. In retrospect, I probably should have targeted more places and broader domains, but I was lucky that I got an internship quickly.
Also, the timings matter. If you email the profs at the wrong moment, it will probably end up in their spam emails, and they will never see it.
Stark differences between 3rd Year OCS internship vs 2nd Year research internship.
It is entirely different. The third-year process is very formalised. You have to follow many rules and a fixed schedule; with third-year interns, there are a lot of tests and many more opportunities, and all of your friends are sitting in the third-year internship as well, unlike the second-year intern. The second-year process is very chill, like it doesn‚Äôt really matter if you get an internship back then, but the third-year internship is something you really look forward to.
RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Work Experience at INRIA, and relationship with advisors, colleagues, and friends there.
With INRIA, the location (Southern France) is enchanting. If your friends are joining you there, it is a plus point. Work-wise, it is a research project; you don‚Äôt know what to do and what to expect. You start by reading papers and discussions and slowly start getting an idea and start implementing it
.
For me, it was relatively chill during the first half, but it got a bit more intense in the second half when the ideas started pouring in. In the latter half, I was putting in 8-9 hours of work every day, compared to the 4-5 hours when I started.
I have observed that in other places, your advisor meets or talks to you once, like five days, but in INRIA, your advisor will be in constant touch with you (for me, it was twice a day). When starting with research, I feel that one needs a lot of guidance, and INRIA provided me with that; I really enjoyed conversing with my advisor.
As far as the environment is concerned, INRIA is a French multinational institution. There were people from Britain, the USA, and India as well, and you had lunch with them daily, so it was fun.
Non-working hours during the internship period.
We used to hang out with the other team members (not our advisors or any chief scientist) in our spare time and go around places together. The IITD students, in particular, used to roam around France together. We moved around the South France region, and went to Paris once as well. So, even outside work, we were all very social with each other (the people at the INRIA centre).
On personal experiences and balancing out work and personal life.
I had moved out of the country once (for work), and that was for about ten days with many friends and much more formal stuff. At INRIA, it was much longer; I was practically living there for two and a half months. It was similar to living in the college, except the food and climate were different. Though I had fewer friends at the INRIA centre (from IITD), I improved my friendships with everyone there. We used to chill together and work together, just like in college, and to be honest, the work here was just like solving an assignment for me.
Though my life here was more structured, I could easily pull off all-nighters and sleep between class breaks in college, but you cannot do that while working anywhere.
Personal feelings about delving into newer fields and on the conclusion of the intern.
This internship was the first time I was looking at approximate and randomised algorithms, I had heard of them, but this time, I was working with them. After that, I was exposed to a plethora of new algorithms and how they work, which was fantastic for me, at least because I might not have been exposed to them if I had stayed at IITD because the things we did there and the things we do here in college are very different.
As far as my work integrating with SBL (Standard Bioinformatics Library) is concerned, it feels cool knowing that I would be able to contribute to an extensive library with lakhs of lines of code and having my code there (actually meaningful code) that would help someone else to build something on their own, you don‚Äôt experience things like that. Had I been at some other place, I probably would not have had that much impact.
On managing both the second-year internship and third-year internship prep.
For the third-year internship prep, I mainly relied on solving maths puzzles. I revised all the relevant courses I had during that period. Whatever time I could get, particularly on the weekends or someday when I was not making any progress, I would look at some preparation material, highly guided by seniors, doing what they told me without questioning anything (they knew what to do better than me).
If I had to do something differently, I would start my third-year internship prep earlier, probably during my fourth semester, because I skimmed down a lot of parts of my third-year internship, which I could have been able to balance out.
Impact of the second-year internship on the third-year internship choices.
It had a very positive effect, not necessarily because you don‚Äôt have a research organisation coming for your third-year intern. People understand the value of INRIA if they work in a foreign firm or have little exposure to undergraduate CS research, so it is an excellent name to have in your CV.
The roles that I was looking forward to didn‚Äôt change much, as I had a prior idea beforehand that I wanted to do either Software or Quantitative research (and I ended up choosing that only). Still, I developed a stronger preference for it being there.
Any regrets about the second-year internship process or the prep for the third-year intern.
I probably could have explored more or focused a bit more during the research internship or could have tried a few new things (or managed my time more efficiently), but if I look back 6-7 months back at what I was hoping to get out of the intern, I believe I largely achieved that.
INRIA has a great work culture, so we had little to no spare time. I witnessed many of my friends, who were also in Europe, travelling a lot across Europe, which isn‚Äôt possible with INRIA, so that would be one of my regrets.
Monetary implications of the internship.
INRIA doesn‚Äôt pay for your flight (French Govt. rules), which is a big problem. If you get the Charpak Scholarship (a scholarship that the French Embassy in India provides), you get an extra 1400 euros while working in France. Strangely, no IITian could secure the Cherpak Scholarship during my year.
Whatever I earned covered my food, flight, and other expenses (probably overshot by a few euros), but all in all, I netted zero off my internship, which is fine because you are not expected to do that anyways. If I factor out my flight tickets, I might have made 500 euros, but factoring it in, it is a net zero (without the Cherpak scholarship).
ADVICES
Any tips for the juniors.
Rely on your seniors a lot; they know how things work out, and they have been through that process, so they have connections in the lab itself. They would be beneficial to you in guiding you through the process.
If you are in the third semester, keep a high CGPA. Many opportunities open up right after the fourth semester starts, so a high CGPA greatly helps.
Enjoy your courses as well, which will help you out for your second-year internship and in everything.

Tanishka Gurjar (CH1)
Domain: Research -
Nitrogen and Phosphorus Harvesting
Interned at IIT Gandhinagar
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Anukriti Jain
Introduction
I am Tanishka Gurjar, a 3rd-year chemical engineering undergraduate at IIT Delhi. I pursued a research internship at IIT Gandhinagar under their Summer Research Internship Program (SRIP). There were around 100 projects to choose from, and I applied through their portal. My research focused on treating urine to harvest nitrogen and phosphorus, to utilise these nutrients in fertilisers.
Motivation
I am deeply passionate about chemical engineering and have always wanted to gain research experience. This 2nd-year internship presented a valuable opportunity for me, both in terms of gaining experience in my core field and enhancing my CV. The internship topic combined biology and chemistry, and as a biochemical enthusiast, I found it particularly appealing.
Pre-Internship Process
My internship was part of the SRIP, with applications opening around March. Many other universities in India also open their internship applications around this time. The process involved going to the portal, creating an account, browsing the available projects, and selecting the ones of interest. For some projects, such as the one I applied for, only a Statement of Purpose (SOP) was required, while others included tests along with SOP shortlisting.
There were many internship topics under SRIP. I reviewed the project descriptions, filtered out the ones I was interested in, and checked if I had any prior knowledge in those areas. For example, one project was about chemical reactors, and another was on material science‚Äîtopics I had covered to some extent in my IITD courses. This ensured I would have some background knowledge, allowing me to fully engage in the internship. I applied to seven projects and was selected for one.
Work Environment
Working at IIT Gandhinagar was an enjoyable experience, largely because of my professor, who was very understanding and kind. For example, when I was busy working on my CV, he allowed me to take a few days off. Another reason I enjoyed the work environment was my peers. They had already completed their bachelor's degrees and were far more experienced than I was. Despite meeting them for the first time, I quickly became comfortable talking to them and discussing any problems I faced. They were always willing to help, whether it was explaining the tasks I needed to complete or introducing me to the machinery and its operation. I never felt abandoned or left to figure things out on my own.
Working Hours
The working hours varied. Since my project involved working with chemicals, the time required depended on how long the chemical reactions took to complete, unlike software internships where the work is often based on set hours of coding. If a reaction took nine hours, I had to wait for nine hours. As a result, I had a lot of free time during the early stages of the internship, often working just 2-3 hours a day. However, as the focus shifted to analysis rather than creating samples, my workload increased, and I worked 6-7 hours a day.
When I had finished my assigned work, one of the PhD seniors working with me mentioned that he had spoken to my professor and needed help with his thesis. He was working on methylene blue absorption by gels and their potential use in drug delivery. For about 2-3 weeks, I helped him with this project, and sometimes I even worked for up to 12 hours a day.
Post-Internship Experience and Key Takeaways
After the internship, I felt a surge in confidence, especially since my life at IIT Delhi had never been particularly smooth or relaxed. At IIT Gandhinagar, I gained a fresh perspective. I didn't know anyone there, so I wasn't pressured to fit into any predefined expectations. I was alone, managed everything myself, interacted with people independently, and worked as a research intern. This experience made me realise my potential and boosted my confidence. I understood that I could handle tasks and had the energy and capability to complete whatever I was assigned.
I received a certificate for completing the internship, an LoR from my professor, and the project I worked on under the PhD senior was mentioned in the LoR. I also received a stipend, and there is a cash prize for the best intern.

Abhinav Shrivastava - SURA, IITD
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 9, 2024
5 min read
Abhinav Shrivastava (PH1)
Domain: Research (Core)
Interned at IITD (SURA)
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Sachal Dudani
MOTIVATION
I often have my doubts about almost everything going on in my life, but if there was one thing I was crystal clear about right from the start, it would be pursuing a career in research. This was also why I opted for Engineering Physics as a branch. This made life simpler in a sense that I didn‚Äôt need to worry and stress out about other aspects one would tick off for an internship in another profile. Just study your courses and pick some projects, and your summer is sorted.
For me, SURA took an edge over other foreign internships because I feel that without previous experience, there is no advanced experimentation you could perform or learn from in an environment like that in a foreign internship. Since it was my first project, I looked for a fostering environment that could be more productive and a better learning experience.
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION PROCESS
After the SURA notification was out, I contacted my professor - Kaushik Sen, in early March. We actually knew each other beforehand, and I had also previously troubled him during our courses. After him teaching quantum mechanics in PYL101, I took his course regarding solid states physics in the 4th semester, during which the project idea was generated. The lectures covered the theoretical aspect, which intrigued me and made me contact the professor to try out the prospect of an experimental project in this field. I have mostly been interested in the theoretical stuff but wanted to try out a new hands-on experience, so I went the offline experimental route to get a taste of it. We started off the project in early May, but created a framework, and presented it to a pane beforehand, which was followed by other subsequent rounds where our project was reviewed by panels of professors. Finally, we were selected for the Summer Undergraduate Research Award (SURA).
INTERNSHIP: WORK AND EXPERIENCE
As a research intern, I delved into a project dealing with thin film preparation for single photon detection. My role was to prepare these thin films of around 10-20 nanometers using ITC superconductors, which were used to prepare nanowires for single photon detection and found various applications in quantum communication.
I was pleasantly surprised by the PhD students and project guides who, along with the professor, guided me throughout the project. They surpassed my expectations and genuinely committed to helping me complete the experiment correctly and gain extensive knowledge in the process. Even the professor came in daily to discuss about the project.
Through such an experience in the lab, you learn to appreciate the time and effort the researchers put in and get to think from a different perspective. My biggest takeaway from the internship would be a change in perspective towards research. I could say that now I am more inclined to think like a researcher. I am more intrigued about researching stuff taught in classes and enjoy doing so.
CHALLENGES: ON AND OFF THE INTERNSHIP
We definitely had a pretty notable roadblock to face during the internship. We had to form a compound that had to be crushed, then put into a furnace, then crushed again, then put into a furnace, and so on‚Ä¶.you get the jist of it. In one of those iterations, the furnace broke down, and with the equipment being as infrastructurally complex as they are, the work came to a halt, and it took a good 2-3 weeks to get the machine back up and working.
The redeeming factor, however, was that I still had complete access to the labs. So I would reach there at 10 am and pester other PhD students and ask them about their research and contribute to their experiments. Overall, the professor and the PhD guides ensured that no time was wasted, and even after the setback, the two months were well utilized to my personal and academic satisfaction.
I spent 10 am-6 pm in the lab only. In the off hours, it actually got really dull and gloomy, with just fewer people in the hostel. There was an absence of company while sitting alone in the room and mess. You need to find something you enjoy doing during your off hours to take your mind away from what you did in the lab. My evenings would be spent writing poetry or just heading out and exploring the city.
LEARNINGS AND OUTCOMES
This internship experience transformed me in many ways. In 2nd year, I was sure that I wanted to pursue research, but I would spend a lot of time in extracurriculars, clubs, and societies. Now, from all my learnings, I have come to the conclusion that those ECAs and club activities don't really matter much to me if I head towards a career in research. I still haven't completely cut off the extracurriculars, but I am utilizing my time better and am more focused on research projects and academics that would actually substantially help me in my career.
I had the desire to experience experimental physics and delve deeper into it, but after the internship, I came to the conclusion that it probably just wasn't for me. There is a lot of patience and frustration involved, like the equipment breaking down, for instance. I am more inclined towards the theoretical aspect. Still, the upside was that the overall experience helped me gain the perspective of an experimental researcher, which could help me think deeper about how they would approach stuff when I am pursuing theoretical research.
I built connections with PhD students and other experts in the fields with whom I could discuss anything related or unrelated to research. I now have friends with whom I can talk about the domains I am interested in, which was difficult earlier, even in my branch-where there were only a handful of peers inclined towards research.
TIPS FOR JUNIORS
Looking back, I probably should have had some prior project experience, perhaps during the last summer or winter, before setting out for this intern. It would have given me a clearer perspective about how things work beforehand and allowed me to learn more during this project, utilizing it to the maximum capacity. This was my first project, so I couldn't really explore many avenues, which would perhaps have been easier in the counterfactual. So, my advice to juniors would be to utilize your summers and winters just to EXPLORE.
If one explores different fields like research projects, consults, tech internships, etc., during their vacations, they could make an informed decision based on what they enjoy and not rely on any preconceived notions that may just be completely invalid for them.

Pradumn Agarwal - Kotak Securities
BSP
Sep 9, 2024
5 min read
Pradumn Agarwal (ME1)
Domain: Fintech
Interned at
Kotak Securities, Mumbai
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Anuradha Barnwal
Introduction
Hi, I am Pradumn. I'm in my third year, and currently pursuing Btech in mechanical engineering. I am an outreach Coordinator in the International Programmes and Economics Club. I will be an international exchange student this semester at Denmark Technical University. Besides that, I play badminton and read a lot on the news and the internet. I do like my branch. I used to like physics in school, and my branch in college is somewhat oriented and aligned with that. I like some courses, but I just pass a few others to get away with them.
Could you please tell us about your intern role at Kotak Institutional Equities?
I interned at Kotak Institutional Securities, a subsidiary of Kotak Securities. They act as an intermediary between the clients and stock exchange by securing your deals. Kotak Institutional Equities caters explicitly to institutional clients, such as firms and higher-ticket clients.
Regarding my role, it was more on a tech oriented side. So, they had few ideas about generative AI and the automation of repetitive tasks at their firm. They had ideas of how to implement it, but they wanted a clear road map on how to go about it. So, along with two other students from IIT KGP and IIT Bombay, we worked for around one and a half months, looking for solutions. We compared them and tried to develop a feasible roadmap for their software to help them reduce the man-hours.
MOTIVATION
What were the domains you were interested in before going through the process of applying, and what motivated you to narrow it down to this internship?
I tried and tested everything I had a remote interest in. I knew I wasn't into coding and software development, so I did not apply to AI and software companies. I enjoy finance and read a lot about economics, but it's not something I like to pursue in the long run. Consulting, on the other hand, offers you the opportunity to work on different projects, with each being different from the last one. That was something that excited me and compelled me to try for that. I am more into reading, getting the crux out of things, and drawing insights from some data. I was also trying to get into something that would help me enter the management profiles. I had heard that a good internship at a reputed business school/corporate company helped a lot, so I tried to get into BIG4, some VC firms, etc. I was also applying for opportunities that came up along LinkedIn. One thing I suggest is to follow as many people as possible on LinkedIn because it helps with networking and getting you aware of better opportunities. I, too, got to know about this internship opening through LinkedIn and followed through.
Could you tell us more about your internship at HEC Paris?
At HEC Paris, there is a professor from the Department of Operations working with a professor from Queen's Business School of London on news syndication. They extracted old news articles and find some patterns using ML models. During this internship, it became clear to me that research is something I don't have a keen interest in. This strengthened my decision to pursue other interests.
APPLICATION PROCESS
While applying for these internships, you must've mailed hundreds of people. How excruciating was the process, and how did you cope with the rejections?
As mentioned, I got this position through a LinkedIn opening in mid/late May. Before this, I did one research internship at IIM Lucknow, where I co-authored papers with professors from the Department of Sustainability and I'm working with a few professors from HEC Paris and other universities-something I started a few months before my offline internship at Kotak Institutional Equity. While emailing professors during September, I got an idea of how to approach people. Things like sending a reminder email every 10-15 days, prompting a response/engaging in discussions, getting feedback, highlighting the right keywords, and keeping the word count adequate can tremendously affect your chances. I had an offer in early November, which cheered me up a little amongst all the rejections.
Was there any Pre-intern preparation involved?
I only prepared a little before applying for my IIM Lucknow internship-I had a cover letter, a mailing list, a good CG, some technical projects, and a couple of PoRs under me, so I was good to go. I did not do any specific courses. I had a couple of projects under me in 1st year, but it was cold mailing many profs that scored my two research internships. I don't think I can emphasise it enough, but I highly advise looking out on Linkedin for positions that might open in your prospective fields/companies. While sending 500+ personalised mails was hard, at the end of the day, you don't need a hundred replies. You need one yes from the right place and person. So, that thought kept me going.
INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE
How was the work experience in general?
As it was an offline internship, going to the office at finance capital at BKC, Mumbai and working alongside those seasoned traders was something that I thoroughly enjoyed. We had those eight monitor screens to work on, and good food was served all day. We did have a couple of restrictions; for e.g., we couldn't use our phones during work hours for privacy reasons or move between floors too. Did I mention that I have signed an NDA agreement? Haha. While working there, I had a manager above me, and the team was big. I had two or three people to report to and from whom I had to take instructions. They were quite generous and helped me throughout the journey. So, it was pretty exciting and easygoing, not very technical or challenging from day one. I had some pretty amazing fellow intern students; it was nice sitting around them and getting to know what happened at different IITs, their recruiting structure, and what kind of companies come on campus. I had a good time there, and we are in touch now.
LEARNINGS AND ADVICE
Any Personal takeaway?
On a personal basis, I learned how to manage my time well. Between meeting deadlines, interacting with professionals, doing club work, and third-year intern prep, I had to manage my time accurately. That no phone rule during work hours did get me out of my obsession of checking my phone every five minutes, and now I generally don't waste countless hours on my phone.
Also, did I mention that my sister lives in Mumbai? I used to party a lot in Mumbai with her; we'd go cafe hopping and sightseeing. I got to cut on rent, maid/cook and food, so that was a major plus. We disconnected due to my JEE phase, but this opportunity allowed me to reconnect with her.
Your best advice to juniors?
Have a good sleep schedule. Managing clubs, academics, internships, mailing and exploring can take a significant toll on your body mentally and physically, so proper rest is necessary. The next thing is to reach out to as many people as you can, be it on LinkedIn, drop emails if a position opens for a person at some firm or you can directly see if there is a senior of yours who has worked at the same place and try to ask him if he can recommend you. Try getting research interns, reading many articles, and connecting with professors- they help a lot, even if your goal isn't research. Keep exploring things that seem interesting to you rather than following hearsay.

Nikhil Gupta - PanScience Innovations
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 9, 2024
5 min read
Updated:
Sep 9, 2024
Nikhil Gupta (CH1)
Domain: Product Management
Interned at PanScience Innovations, Delhi
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Pragun Pudukoli
INTRODUCTION
I am a 3rd-year Chemical Engineering student. I have recently interned at PanScience Innovations, where my role was Associate Product Manager.
MOTIVATION
I was open to going for most kinds of internships apart from those related to coding. After studying computer science in classes 11th and 12th and COL100 in my first year in college, I was determined that I do not like coding. To understand research internships better, I took up a project under a Professor at IIT Delhi during the winter break after my third semester. After doing this project, I felt that I did not have a strong inclination towards research in this field although I like chemistry as a field. After this realisation, I only did a little cold mailing for research internships. Then, I decided to try for a business internship to gain experience in this.
I was willing to do a business internship in any of the offered fields that did not involve coding, which is how I narrowed it down to Product Management.
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION PROCESS
I made up my mind to do a business internship in January. Since my fourth semester was very hectic in both academics and extracurriculars, therefore I managed to start the mailing process only after the end of my fourth semester. I would not recommend this, though. Start as soon as possible if you have decided on what type of internship you wish to do.
Your enthusiasm and interest to learn are what matter in your application. The people who are hiring you know that you have done only two years of college. They know how much they can expect from you. After you start the internship, you will be told what you have to learn, and then you can acquire the required skills. So, unlike coding-related internships, where you may have to know a particular language or application in advance, and research internships, where professors may look at the courses you have taken, your interest in doing the internship is what mainly matters here. There was no hard preparation that I did. I made a CV more oriented to business internships, which greatly concentrated on my ECAs and PORs. While hiring for business interns, people look for ECAs and PORs; they matter, but you can also mention some ECAs that may not be on eacademics portal which are something you would have done on your own.
INTERNSHIP: WORK AND EXPERIENCE
PanScience Innovation is a startup incubator. It helps different startups to grow and provides resources. I had two roles there.
Firstly, I worked with a specific startup, Parchaa, a healthcare AI system. My job here was to evaluate where Parchaa could be used. I researched the rural healthcare system a lot to understand it and think about how Parchaa could be included in it. I also looked at what the competitors of Parchaa were offering so that our system could be made better than those provided by others. Some of my work was also related to outreach. I contacted NGOs and told them about Parchaa. Such work can involve drafting emails and preparing brochures. The other role was the overall management of PanScience Innovations, which involved catering to different startups. I had to streamline the communication with various startups.
A lot of communication and talking is involved in a Product Management role. However, your role could be more flexible at a startup because they are not fully developed companies with a defined structure. Therefore, being in a PM role here does not mean you will only do tasks related to a PM role.
Most of the people I worked with were helpful and friendly. Occasionally, I had the opportunity to do fun activities as well. There were some other people from IIT Delhi at PanScience as well. I used to talk to them. Although most people were friendly, some were strict. So, the whole experience was a mixed one for me.
CHALLENGES FACED
I got a lot of rejections initially while applying for internships. I became very anxious when I was not getting any replies to my emails. I was worried about whether I would get an internship or not.
Working in a startup requires a lot of effort. I knew I would have to put in much hard work. My work hours were from 9 AM to 7 PM. I had a hectic schedule. I had to wake up early, and after returning at 7 PM, I had to do tasks related to my position as Chief Editor at BSP. The work I had to do easily consumed my whole day. It was challenging to manage everything I had to do, including preparing for my third-year internship and the tasks I had to do related to the clubs I was part of.
To manage other tasks along with my internship, I utilised the free time and breaks I used to have in the office. During this one-month internship, I did not prepare much for the third-year internship process. After this internship, I did another one which was online, so I had enough time to prepare then.
LEARNINGS
Although I had a very fruitful experience, if I had started my mailing process earlier, like in the early fourth semester, I could have gotten a more suitable company where I would have had a better work experience. Before this internship, I was not much into business and how companies or startups work, but this internship helped me gain knowledge in these domains. I got a lot of unique information about startups. I also learned how to communicate formally because one part of my internship involved pitching to NGOs.
The mailing process requires a lot of patience, which I didn‚Äôt have then. One should have enough patience during this process.
Sometimes, during your internship, you get scolded when you don't perform up to the expectations of the manager. At that time, it is normal to feel nervous and insecure. You do feel bad at that time, but this is very common. If you are unable to do something, you can learn it later. Whenever managers and HRs make such statements, they do not really mean it. They are also frustrated. So, do not take any of these words very close to your heart, and do not get disheartened because it is a part of the work culture in many companies. People working in companies are accustomed to this culture.
TIPS FOR JUNIORS
Everyone should try to do an internship after the second year as it is a good experience and a great way to learn things. Do not choose an internship just because you will get to travel somewhere. Although this could be an additional reason, you should also learn something from it.
If you are still deciding on the role you want, apply for different types of roles, such as research and business internship positions. Finally, depending on the offers you get, you can decide later what kind of role you want to do.
Everyone can get an internship after their fourth semester, but depending on how soon you begin the process, the quality of the internship you get can differ.
Talk to as many seniors as possible. You can specifically talk to seniors who have already interned in the companies you plan to apply for. There are some companies where IIT Delhi students generally intern. You can learn about the work experience in such companies by contacting seniors.

Tanya Jain - TrueHue
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 9, 2024

Tanya Jain (MT1)
Domain: Machine Learning Intern
Interned at TrueHue (startup)
Mode: Online
Interviewed by: Anushka Gupta
MOTIVATION:
My primary motives behind a second-year internship were to venture into a new domain and enhance my CV. I had tried out DSA projects during a course, but machine learning was something I had yet to work on as part of my coursework. I had done some online courses for ML and found them intuitive and rewarding, so I was particularly inclined towards them. The beauty of algorithms guiding machines to understand the data and make highly accurate predictions was enchanting to understand. Additionally, since Machine learning is so helpful in all domains nowadays, it seemed like a resourceful option to explore.
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION PROCESS:
I was always inclined toward a corporate internship but also applied for research. Initially, I was also interested in a foreign research internship. So, I started applying for it in December, and after seeing the abysmal denial rates, I quickly realized it was too late. Then, I started looking into off-campus corporate interns on LinkedIn and Unstop, and I did this from December to January. Around January, I got a reply from the company about my interviews‚Äîthe two rounds tested my understanding of ML algorithms and gauged my approach to data analysis problems. Then, after the two rounds of interviews, I got accepted at the end of February. The actual internship was two months long, from May to July.
For preparation, I embarked on the renowned machine learning specialisation by Andrew Ng online. This experience was truly eye-opening and deepened my interest in machine learning. Furthermore, I started learning about valuable libraries and tools in Python, such as Tensorflow, Scikit, etc. Amongst other resources, there is also this book called "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron, which was a tremendously helpful read. Subsequently, I delved into Kaggle hackathons and took inspiration from projects on YouTube to gain hands-on experience. These projects were instrumental in empowering me with practical skills and knowledge.
ACTUAL EXPERIENCE:
It was an AI-powered beauty startup called TrueHue.
It is an innovative beauty tech startup that leverages AI to redefine the online shopping experience.
I had to create machine learning models to classify natural human lip pigmentation and use various data analysis techniques. One exciting thing was that I had to start everything from scratch without any starter code. I was just given raw data, so I had to pre-process and analyze it from scratch and create classifiers and categories. I was initially called to work from Ahmedabad, but I requested that they let me opt out of offline work. Since I had to work away from home for my 3rd-year internship, I wanted to stay with my family and friends during my 2nd-year internship. Also, working from home worked out for me better because I had more flexible working hours and could manage and take out time for my third-year internship preparation. The internship went very well and was better than I had expected. I got to learn a lot about both machine learning and work ethics. A big plus point was my motivating and optimistic manager, who had a lot of faith in me. Anytime I got stuck, she believed that I could crack it. The internship went smoothly, and I gained valuable insights about both corporate jobs and machine learning. Since it was a startup, I did not expect a high stipend. But I got a decent amount of 50K for the whole 2-month duration. Ultimately, the model gave fantastic results, and I got a sparkling recommendation from my manager on LinkedIn. It immensely helped me during the interviews for my 3rd-year internship.
CHALLENGES FACED:
When it comes to choosing an internship, it's important to pursue something that excites you and will enhance your academic record. Additionally, 2nd-year internships can be challenging because there isn't as much guidance on where to apply and how to prepare compared to the more structured process for 3rd-year internships. To overcome this hurdle, many students rely on advice from seniors to help them navigate the process.
During the internship, juggling a 9-5 work role along with the demanding third-year intern prep was tiring. Even so, since I had opted for work from home, I was able to devote approximately 5 hours to my daily preparation.
LEARNINGS:
The internship was a valuable learning experience for me. I learned to take responsibility and have confidence in my abilities. I also had the opportunity to work with neural networks and various other machine learning models, which helped me gain invaluable skills in data analysis and model creation.
TIPS:
1)Try not to focus solely on your existing interests. Keep an open mind about new opportunities and be willing to explore new things.
2)One of the most crucial tips I can offer is to start your application process as early as possible. This proactive approach will give you ample time to research, prepare, and apply, significantly increasing your chances of securing a rewarding internship. Early application not only demonstrates your commitment and enthusiasm but also allows you to explore a wider range of opportunities.
3)When contacting recruiters and HR, don't just send your CV. Instead, include a personalized message on LinkedIn (or whichever platform you are using to apply) that highlights your relevant experiences and interests. This personal touch can significantly increase your chances of getting noticed.

Sahil Grover - Ernst & Young
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024
4 min read
Sahil Grover (PH1)
Domain: Government Technology Consulting
Interned at Ernst & Young, Delhi
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by:  Satyam Sharma
INTRODUCTION
I am Sahil Grover, a third-year undergraduate student. I am pursuing a major in BTech in Engineering Physics. I am from Udaigiri Hostel and the current secretary of the Literary Club. I was an associate consultant intern at Ernst and Young‚Äôs government consulting unit known as ITPMU.
MOTIVATION
Why do you think people lacking interest in core or tech are inclined to pick consulting?
The perspective is varied, considering the number of consulting companies that come to campus looking for problem solvers and bright minds. The needlessness of prerequisite training is another nudge in that direction. Additionally, there is a lack of alternative options. I‚Äôll take my department as an example. Engineering Physics has virtually no core companies that come to campus. A few companies are open to us, but they‚Äôre open to the electrical department as well, and they prefer the electrical folks. I have not seen any other companies apart from tech and quant present on the OCS portal. This has resulted in a low placement ratio for students from my department in those sectors. Ultimately, our main opportunities are in finance and consulting, which I‚Äôm genuinely interested in pursuing.
APPLICATION PROCESS
In my experience, people who get corporate internships generally choose one of two cases: trying their luck on LinkedIn or by connections in their family. I initially wanted a foreign internship, so I should have started applying early. However, the even semester came in the way, and I lost my direction and started seriously applying right after my majors. Before the majors, I had sent about 10-15 emails, which I believe is a very poor number. I remember being disappointed then, hopeless that I wouldn‚Äôt get an internship in the summer. Following this, I sent about a thousand emails over a month.
I guess one of the emails hit the right person. I had been applying to both foreign universities and management roles. I even got a lead from Cambridge, but their selection process was quite intensive and time-consuming. I had mailed this guy, a partner at EY, which trickled down to a few branches: the director, the manager, and the senior associate. I had a call interview, which went terribly (according to me). They asked
many questions from my CV, which I was unprepared
for. Surprisingly enough, I got a call back from them inviting me to join as an intern.
INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE
Government consulting is a little different from corporate consulting. The work hours are decided by the government, and they are roughly around 9:00 am to 6:30 pm. The team I was a part of provided services to the government, a propriety project management portal. I was tasked with benchmarking the portal we had with the market leaders. I used to brainstorm with a consultant twice or thrice a week to talk about the changes we could implement. Since my internship was for 40 days, nothing concrete came out of it, but it helped me learn a lot. The internship was similar to a project I had done on Forage. In a GovTech consulting firm, there is less work than in a corporate consulting firm, and I did not have a proper supervisor. I could‚Äôve passed 40 days without doing anything. What I tried to do best was to listen to what was going on. One of my notable contributions to the team was adding a risk assessment/ management module to the portal in the future. It would increase efficiency in the long run for our clients, and if clients are happy, we will get more money.
One of the things I remember is that we used to celebrate many birthdays and we would all have fun. The team was very collaborative, unlike the high-level politics and cut-throat competition that big corporate firms usually have.
I had a few opportunities to meet officials at higher ranks. I observe that the higher you move, the more serious the people are about work because the stakes increase.¬†As they moved up, somehow, their voices got louder, and their handshakes got firmer.
As for my 3rd-year internship preparation, it only overlapped a little with my 2nd-year intern work primarily because consulting internships do not require months of preparation. You have to spend a few weeks practicing cases. So, I started a while after the completion of my 2nd year internship.
TAKEAWAYS
I was already inclined towards consulting, but this internship really cemented my decision to pursue it. It made me doubly sure that this was the field I wanted to go to since I had no interest in core or coding. I also feel that the internship had improved my work ethic since you have to sit from 9 to 6, and you can‚Äôt cut classes like here in college. If you sit in front of the laptop in a cubicle and everybody near you is working, you are not going to sit idle. You will be forced into working. Since pursuing this internship, I've only seen positive changes in my time and schedule management along with work ethic.¬† I can firmly say that I value my connections and experience the most out of this internship.
ADVICE
I would suggest my juniors work on their LinkedIn profile and apply early. It would be best if you always learned about the company you‚Äôre applying to. Be confident. Work on your communication skills (and try Forage, maybe). Try attending case competitions and sessions companies have on campus. I would strongly suggest they do a second-year internship since it also gives an idea of how they need to work in corporate, present themselves decently, and employ their people skills to the maximum. Confidence is of paramount importance because a bit of hesitation can lead the interviewer to think you are doubtful of your skills. Companies need people who can think for themselves and give innovative solutions. They are looking for leaders, so presenting that persona to the company is crucial. In conclusion, I would also advise you not to get disheartened by rejections and to have faith in yourself and your abilities. Keep your head up and hustle hard!

Amishi Gupta - Monash University, Australia
BSP
Sep 8, 2024
3 min read
Amishi Gupta (BB1)
Domain: Research -
Cell Biology
Interned at
Monash University, Australia
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Vanika Fatehchandka
Introduction
I am a current 3rd year Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering student. I recently did a research internship at Monash University, Australia. The primary focus of my research was to study organelle interactions inside cells using fluorescence microscopy and to study the effects of the cell's medium in mitochondrial fusion and fission.
Motivation and Initial Interest
Initially, I was interested in labs working on marine biology and in geometric biology. However, I ended up in a lab focused on basic cell biology, which wasn‚Äôt what I had originally planned. Despite this, once I started working, I realised how fascinating it was to be involved in every step, from sample preparation to data analysis. This experience made me realise the intricacies and excitement of cell biology, which I hadn‚Äôt anticipated.
Preparation and Application Process
I began applying for internships in early January, intending to include my CGPA after the third semester and waiting for the Christmas break to end. The first two weeks were spent researching and shortlisting universities based on my area of interest. The next two weeks were dedicated to the application process, which involved reaching out to professors, writing emails, and gathering the necessary documents. By the end of January, I received a confirmation from a professor at Monash University in Australia for a 9-week internship from May to July.
One of the challenges I faced during this process was the lack of a structured list of universities from seniors who had done similar internships since no comprehensive resource was available, so I had to create my own list.
Internship Experience: Work and Learning
The research internship at Monash University was an enriching experience. My work involved both wet labs and dry labs. The primary focus of my research was to study organelle interactions inside cells using fluorescence microscopy. Specifically, we tagged five organelles and filmed their interactions for over three minutes, analysing how frequently they touched each other. Additionally, I studied how the cell media affects mitochondrial fusion and fission in migrating cells.
I found the lab environment supportive, even though I didn‚Äôt have a specific supervisor. I sought guidance from different experts based on their domains. As the weeks progressed, I became more familiar with the work and developed a better strategy for planning and executing experiments. By the ninth week, I had a solid understanding of the workflow and was able to time my experiments efficiently throughout the week. If I had more time, I would have liked to run additional experiments to explore all the possibilities that intrigued me.
Challenges Faced
One of the key challenges was the lack of a clearly defined objective. My supervisor encouraged me to explore what interested me, but this broad freedom made it challenging to stay focused initially. I spent a significant amount of time on theoretical research, watching YouTube lectures, when I should have been diving into practical work. It cost me a week which I think could have been better utilised.
Key Learnings
This internship taught me that a degree doesn‚Äôt have to define our career path. In the lab, I worked alongside people from diverse backgrounds, including software engineers and physicists. This experience showed me that one can pursue their passions regardless of their academic background.
My experience also reaffirmed my interest in research and solidified my decision to pursue further research internships rather than sitting for OCS placements. The responsibility that comes with research work, coupled with the academic environment, affirmed my desire to continue in this field.
Advice for Juniors
Time is limited during an internship, so it‚Äôs crucial to make the most of it. I would advise balancing paper reading with practical work from the very start of the internship. Although extensive knowledge isn't expected from an intern who has just completed their second year, reading some research papers beforehand can be beneficial.
For those planning to apply for internships, I recommend applying through programs that provide accommodation, as this can make the process much smoother. If you‚Äôre doing an offline internship, make sure to familiarise yourself with local renting laws to avoid any complications.

Rajarshee Das - PayPal
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024

Updated:
Sep 9, 2024
Rajarshee Das (CS1)
Domain: Software Development Engineer(SDE)
Interned at PayPal, Chennai
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Ahilaan Saxena
INTRODUCTION
I'm Rajarshee Das, a third-year CS undergrad at IIT Delhi. I worked as a software engineering intern at Paypal, Chennai, where I contributed to developing an AI-based employee query chatbot.
MOTIVATION
In my 3rd semester, I worked on developing
exam.iitd.ac.in
under the Associate Dean, Curriculum. Aside from giving me hands-on experience in web development, this project led me to explore my interests further. Unlike many of my classmates who have been cold-mailing foreign professors for research internships since October,  I was actively giving contests on codeforces and solving leetcode problems. From the onset, I knew I was inclined towards software development and competitive programming.¬† Thus, I wanted to try to find an off-campus software role.
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION PROCESS
Apart from grinding various level coding problems in the 3rd sem, I gave contests on codeforces to brush up my competitive programming skills for the Online Assessment (OA). I read up on computer science fundamentals and computer architecture, particularly for the objective type assessment. Brainstellar was an excellent site for practising quant-based problems related to probability, discrete math, etc.
I was active on various career portals and LinkedIn pages where HRs and recruiters regularly posted about openings. One such opening for an SDE and data science role in PayPal caught my eye. I applied and gave the OA in December. It had nine questions from CS fundamentals and one programming question of moderate level.
I was shortlisted for the technical round, where I had to solve a programming problem live on a code-sharing platform. The final round was an HR based round where the interviewer asked me about the projects I had mentioned in my CV (including some of my COL106 and COL215 assignments in addition to the project I mentioned before) and some basic OOPS concepts.
To my delight, I got the offer letter from Paypal, Chennai, on 20th January. I had to choose between the online and onsite modes. I worked online for the initial two weeks, packed my bags and left for Chennai in May 2024.
NON WORK EXPERIENCE
I lived alone in a PG, provided under company expenses. The office was 2 kilometres away. I used to wake up at 7:30 AM, reach the office by 9:00 AM and work till 5:00 PM. We reviewed the previous day's work and planned in daily standup meetings.
I was part of the platform engineering team, developing and maintaining internal employee use applications. They provided many Udemy courses and live classes to enhance my knowledge of React, Java, Node, and Spring frameworks, which are crucial to my assigned job. We developed a chatbot on Slack, which took in employee queries as input and was linked to Gen AI, generating responses through our interface.
Evenings were primarily dull after 8 to 9-hour workdays. I would practice CP and quant questions after dinner for my 3rd-year internship preparation. Living alone for the first time was a great experience, I learnt to manage time efficiently and maintain a work-life balance. After the culmination of my internship in August 2024, PayPal gave me a return offer based on my performance for the 3rd year.
TAKEAWAYS AND TIPS FOR JUNIORS
The CG cutoffs for quant companies can go as high as 9+ for CV shortlists. Even for SURA projects, professors choose among numerous applications based on CGPA. So, it's not a good idea to sideline your CG even if you're good at CP or web development. Also, 2nd-year courses like MTL106 and COL106 are the foundation for many probability-based or DSA questions in quant and SDE interviews.
The extent of opportunities you get is quite low in 2nd year, especially for corporate internships. So, it's essential to look for openings on LinkedIn, companies' career portals, or even among your friend circles. It would help if you spent time building your CV in the 3rd semester and took as much advice from your seniors as possible while drafting cover letters.
It is important to decide in the 3rd semester itself whether you want to choose a research or corporate internship or focus solely on your 3rd-year internship process. Each has its ups and downs. Those who do 2nd-year internships generally face a bit of a time shortage when preparing for the OCS tests, which begin as soon as you return in July or August, but trust me, the experience you get is worth it.

Akshay Raj - National Tsinghua University, Taiwan
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024
3 min read
Akshay Raj (CH1)
Domain: Research (Core)- Solar cells
Interned at
National Tsinghua University, Taiwan
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Samyak Sanghvi
MOTIVATION
Regarding my motivation for choosing a research internship during my second year, I was at a stage where I was exploring different fields and figuring out which direction to take next. While many students opt for internships to build their CVs, I wanted to explore the core aspects of my branch and explore the frontier of research within chemical engineering. This is why I gravitated towards a research internship, specifically in the domain of solar cells, which is a groundbreaking future technology. I felt that the knowledge and experience gained in this field could be highly beneficial for my future endeavours.
APPLICATION PROCESS AND PREPARATION
When considering whether to pursue a research internship, I believe it‚Äôs crucial to be well-versed in your core subjects. A solid understanding of the fundamental concepts will allow you to make the most of the experience, enabling you to contribute meaningfully to the research and apply what you‚Äôve learned in a practical setting. Additionally, you should consider your long-term career goals and whether the internship aligns with them. The application process for the internship was quite rigorous. I recommend starting early, ideally around October, and customising your emails to professors to show genuine interest in their work. This personalised approach can significantly increase your chances of receiving a positive response. Unlike the OCS internship process, which is quite streamlined, this is a little more unpredictable; hence, diversifying the universities and professors you apply to is essential, as it increases your chances of securing an internship, especially when funding can be a challenge.
INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE
I had the incredible opportunity to intern at the National Tsinghua University in Taiwan through the TEEP program, where I worked on a research project focused on perovskite solar cells.
During my research internship at the National Tsinghua University in Taiwan, I had an enriching experience that extended far beyond academic learning. In the lab, I focused on perovskite solar cells, spending the first few weeks diving into literature and getting familiar with the experimental setup. The learning curve was steep, but with guidance from my PhD mentors, I successfully fabricated my first device within a month. The kind of experimental setup and equipment I used there for my research was mind-blowing. The collaborative environment, with electrical and chemical engineers working together, provided me with valuable interdisciplinary exposure. Outside of the lab, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Taiwan. Living in Hsinchu, I found the city beautiful and spent my evenings exploring local sights and trying different foods. The flexible lab hours allowed me to balance work with leisure, making my overall experience both productive and enjoyable. The cultural differences, especially the strong sense of civic duty and discipline among the locals, left a lasting impression on me, and I‚Äôve actively sought to incorporate these values into my own life since returning.
THINGS YOU COULD HAVE DONE BETTER
Reflecting on my experiences, I have a few significant regrets. I wish I had approached my applications with more diversification rather than concentrating on just a few universities at a time. A more balanced strategy could have provided me with a broader range of opportunities and potentially better choices. Additionally, my management of the application timeline was inconsistent; although I completed my applications promptly, I delayed sending them out, which may have slowed down the process and affected my chances. I also regret declining an offer from National Taiwan University due to the lower stipend they offered. In hindsight, NTU‚Äôs strong reputation might have been a valuable asset, even though I felt more aligned with the research project at NTHU, which ultimately seemed like the right choice. Lastly, I regret not being more active in immersing myself in Taiwanese culture. The language barrier was a challenge, and I could have made a greater effort to connect with people and learn more about the culture, which would have enriched my experience and helped me integrate better into the community.
TIPS
For juniors aiming for research internships, I‚Äôd recommend starting the search and application process early, ideally by October, to give yourself plenty of time to tailor your applications. Customise each one to reflect a genuine interest in the professor‚Äôs work, showing that you‚Äôve done your homework on their research. Building a standout CV is crucial; it highlights relevant projects and skills. Connecting with seniors who have completed similar internships and asking for their advice can provide valuable insights and help refine your CV. Don‚Äôt limit yourself to one university‚Äîapply to a range of institutions to increase your chances. Be consistent and organized, as you may face rejections and need to manage multiple applications. If you're interning abroad, immerse yourself in the local culture and learn the language to enhance your experience. Balancing your research with exploring the new environment will make the internship more fulfilling.

Priyanshu Agarwal - SURA
BSP
Sep 8, 2024
2 min read
Priyanshu Agarwal (CS1)
Domain: Research (SURA)
Interned at IIT Delhi
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Umang Badetia, Yuv Verdia
Introduction
I‚Äôm Priyanshu Agarwal, a
B.Tech
student in Computer Science. During my second year, I applied for the Summer Undergraduate Research Award (SURA) and worked on a project under Professor Rahul Garg focused on identifying and classifying brain strokes using machine learning. This project turned out to be one of the most significant experiences in my academic journey.
Why I Chose SURA
Before applying for SURA, I spent time exploring various professors' research areas and was drawn to Professor Garg‚Äôs work. It aligned with my interest in computer vision and machine learning. Though I considered applying for foreign internships, SURA allowed me to stay in Delhi, giving me a chance to balance both the research project and preparation for my third-year OCS internship, which also aligned with this project as I will be heading over to Smasung HQ, Korea for research in similar domains.
Diving into the Project
My project involved developing models to classify brain stroke conditions using medical images. At that time, I was new to machine learning and deep learning, so there was a steep learning curve. To prepare, I took Stanford‚Äôs deep learning course, which was instrumental in helping me get up to speed. The project itself was a hands-on experience, from sourcing datasets to implementing models in PyTorch. It was demanding, but the practical knowledge I gained was invaluable.
Challenges and Learning
One of the biggest challenges was managing my time effectively, balancing the research work, especially as I was also preparing for internship placements. I found that setting daily targets and maintaining a disciplined schedule was essential. Working closely with a PhD student was also incredibly helpful. His guidance made navigating the complexities of research much easier.
Lessons Learned
A key takeaway from this experience was the importance of documentation and organisation. I started using tools like Notion to keep track of my work, which made me more structured in my approach to both academic and personal projects. Additionally, interacting with PhD students and professors gave me a deeper insight into the world of research and helped me decide whether it‚Äôs something I want to pursue long-term.
Advice for Juniors
For anyone considering a second-year internship or research project, my advice is to explore your interests early and be strategic about your choices. When applying for opportunities like SURA, reach out to multiple professors and talk to seniors who have worked with them to get a better understanding of what to expect. Preparing through online courses and hands-on projects is crucial, especially if you're venturing into new domains like machine learning. Most importantly, be sure of your decisions and learn from every experience.

Sushant Kumar - Harvard University
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024
4 min read
Sushant Kumar (EE1)
Domain: Research-Machine Learning
Interned at Harvard, Massachusetts
Mode: Online
Interviewed by: Samarth Tiwari
MOTIVATION
Even before cracking IIT, I used to read articles about new technologies being developed and research going on in top colleges of the world. I have a keen interest in Applied Mathematics, Quantum Computing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs). After the boom of chatGPT, I became fascinated by the applications of Machine Learning. So, I wanted to pursue a research internship in ML. I got selected to be a part of the HW1 group (Hardware Dataset 1) at the Edge Computing Lab at Harvard. I was involved in the implementation of the frontend and backend of RTL Design. I also worked on the integration of silicon compiler and Langchain prompts.
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION PROCESS
I like to read research papers and articles. Google DeepMind was a handy resource. It has lots of articles and podcasts about recent technological breakthroughs. I used to spend time reading primarily on weekends, so managing coursework was also easy. I would clarify that a sophomore is not expected to be an expert in any field. You just need to show your willingness to learn and be excited about the project. If someone wants to dig deep into any topic, I¬† would suggest approaching a professor on campus as the best way to get started. Coming to my application process, cold mailing was the way to go. I wrote around 200 e-mails to different professors around the world. I was seeking international opportunities, as I feel that I will have ample opportunities to do research in India as well. I want to be in a position to compare both and make future decisions based on that. I started emailing professors in January. My CV was shortlisted at Harvard, and I was sent research papers to read. I was then given a dataset based on the research papers to check my understanding and application skills. My math skills proved to be advantageous and helped me perform well in their evaluation and around February end, I got the acceptance letter. Following my acceptance, the professor sent me 1-2 research papers every week.
INTERNSHIP: WORK AND EXPERIENCE
The research work was from May to July end in online mode. For my part, I used to get a research paper every week and had to work on its implementation. The daily work was for 1 to 1.5 hours, but the working hours were flexible. We had weekly review meetings on Fridays. Surprisingly, the approach to the work was something very unexpected for me. I thought being well-read about a topic would suffice, but in reality, you need to stay updated about the latest developments in the field. My instructors during the research were very knowledgeable and helpful. They provided me access to Harvard's resources and recommended several books and websites for my overall development in ML. During weekends, we used to have video calls with my colleagues, discussing life apart from work. We used to have a lot of fun playing online games like Among Us.
CHALLENGES FACED
One of the biggest challenges that most people face is getting a positive reply to one‚Äôs application. I received only two positive replies after reaching out to more than 200 people. Professors generally hesitate to give research opportunities to sophomores, usually due to their lack of genuine interest in the field and inexperience. I would suggest reaching out directly to the professor rather than through the university‚Äôs website and having a genuine interest in their research. I would have loved to do research onsite, but unfortunately, I had to do it online. The work experience that you gain working onsite is priceless. Sometimes, due to the difference in time zones, the meeting timings disturbed my sleep cycle a bit.
LEARNINGS
My interest in ML has increased manifolds after I completed my internship. I received a Letter of Appreciation and a Letter of Recommendation from Harvard. These are the best things that a student can hope to get after working on a research project. It even helps if you want to go down the corporate route in the future. Research is always a team effort and the best part about a foreign intern is the long-lasting and multi-dimensional connections you make with like-minded people which will help in one‚Äôs future endeavors. The research had a deeper impact on me. It changed my mentality as a student. Being a product of the JEE process, I, like many others, was a result-oriented person. During the internship, I learned to appreciate the process of achieving the results and understand that research is a time-consuming process. The experience instilled in me a sense of patience and discipline.
TIPS FOR JUNIORS
Utilize your first and second year in exploring new ideas and technologies. Resources like research papers and websites like Google DeepMind are really helpful. Gradually try to figure out which fields appeal to you more. Don‚Äôt hesitate in reaching out to the professors working in the field of your interest. Always pursue your interests and avoid running after trends. I just want to clarify that high-paying roles exist in every field; if you love your work, then you can definitely make it big. Sometimes, other than emailing, reaching out to people through platforms like LinkedIn can also provide you with opportunities and resources in the field of your interest. It is a misconception amongst the community that top colleges do not give a positive reply. I believe that it‚Äôs true that getting a research opportunity at a top college is difficult, but if you have genuine interest and passion in a field then opportunities do come. In the end luck also plays a big role while you apply for a research internship. I would advise everyone to let your voice be heard by constantly reaching out to new people and seeking opportunities.

Jahnabi Roy - Aditya Birla Pvt. Ltd.
BSP
Sep 8, 2024
3 min read
Jahnabi Roy (CS1)
Domain:
Data Analytics
Interned at
Aditya Birla Management Corporation Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Lakshita Gupta
Introduction
I‚Äôm Jahnabi, a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student. Last summer, during my second year, I had the opportunity to intern at Aditya Birla Management Corporation Pvt. Ltd. as a data analytics intern. My work primarily involved quantitative finance, focusing on comparative modelling of financial models and backtesting strategies.
Motivation
I chose this internship because I wanted to explore the corporate world. Having already completed a research internship, I was curious to see if a corporate environment would suit me, especially since I‚Äôm considering a corporate career after graduation. The opportunity at Aditya Birla allowed me to dip my toes into this new territory and gain firsthand experience.
Before this internship, I had dabbled in various domains. I participated in programs like the JPMorgan Chase Women‚Äôs Mentorship Program and Google‚Äôs tech interviews. These experiences sparked my interest in both quantitative finance and technology, making the internship at Aditya Birla an ideal fit. While I was eager to explore quant, my background in computer science also pushed me to consider tech roles.
Application Process
The application process for my internship was pretty straightforward. I applied to Aditya Birla because their offices were close to my home in Mumbai. After reaching out to HR on LinkedIn, I sent in my CV and went through three interviews within a week. The entire process took about 10 days, and I was fortunate enough to land the position quickly.
Pre-Internship Preparations
To prepare for the internship, I focused on building relevant skills. A course project in my department for COP290 required me to create a trading simulator, which aligned perfectly with what the internship was looking for. My previous research experience in IIT Bombay and other course projects that I had taken under professors here at IITD helped bolster my profile. While giving interviews for various¬† female programs like JPMC, Google etc. I learnt various stuff like knowledge about derivatives, how tech interviews are conducted. All this together really helped me to be prepared for the internship.
Internship Experience
During the internship, I worked from 9 to 6, tackling tasks like backtesting trading strategies and developing a strategy analysis tool. I received an LOR as well for this. This hands-on work deepened my understanding of finance and gave me practical experience in machine learning, something I hadn‚Äôt formally studied before. The company also provided great perks, like subsidised meals and affordable transportation, which made the experience even more enjoyable. And also on the learning side, I hadn't done any formal ML courses before. I just learned a few courses on Coursera and stuff, which I got to actually implement on real life applications through financial modelling. I also received a stipend of 1 lakh per month.
Looking back, I can say the internship was definitely worth it. It added depth to my profile and helped me gain clarity on what I want to pursue in the future. Although I‚Äôve now shifted my focus to consulting, the skills and knowledge I gained during the internship were invaluable.
Advice for Juniors
For juniors aiming for similar opportunities, my advice would be to be proactive in both communication and networking. It‚Äôs essential to understand how the company operates and to connect with colleagues from various departments. For non-CS students or those with an interest in tech, working on projects through collaborations with professors, online courses, or competitions like Kaggle or hackathons can be highly beneficial. When listing projects on your CV, it‚Äôs best to limit them to five or six to avoid overwhelming yourself during interviews.
Deciding on a career path is never easy, but speaking with seniors who have already navigated these roads can be incredibly helpful. Their insights provided me with a clearer understanding of what to expect and helped me evaluate whether I could envision myself in a particular role for the next five to ten years. Despite interning in quantitative finance, I realised it wasn‚Äôt something I wanted to pursue long-term. This realisation prompted me to shift my focus towards consulting, and I was fortunate to secure an internship with Bain through their True North Scholarship‚Äîa programme that offers scholarships, mentorship, and internships to women.

Abhinav - INSEAD
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024
4 min read
Abhinav (MT1)
Domain: Research (Data Analysis)
Interned at INSEAD, France
Mode: Online
Interviewed by: Anuradha Barnwal
INTRODUCTION
I am Abhinav, a 3rd year Mathematics and Computing student. I am also a Chief Editor in BSP. I have done three research internships and one corporate internship in the past.
Previous experience
My corporate intern was at Boat after my first year. It was in the product role. During my second year, I managed to get three research interns, the first one was at FMS, the Faculty for Management Studies. During winter, I did a research internship at IIM Ahmedabad, and finally at INSEAD Business School, France.
Motivation
Within the first two semesters, it was evident to me that STEM wasn't where I wished to go. For IIT students who don't want to go into STEM, the available career fields then are finance, consulting, private equity, and venture capital, and get a MIM or an MBA down the line. Since I'll be pursuing management in the future, I wanted to get early hands-on experience.
Process of Application
Regarding the timeline, I had a cover letter ready by the end of September, a mailing list during the first two weeks of October, and I had started sending 10 personalised emails per day. Try contacting seniors you know who have interned in that field or school/company. Have them look over your CV or get recommendations by them. With this schedule, I landed¬† my IIM Ahmedabad internship in November, and started working on it right before my FMS internship ended in January. Both FMS and IIM Ahmedabad interns definitely helped my application. The reason I chose INSEAD is because being one of the top management schools in Europe, it'd be a great addition to my resume.
Pre-Internship Preparations, Apprehensions, and Perceptions
The primary factor that helped me land those internships was a domino effect, which meant that my subsequent internships were even more valuable than the last. Since¬†I could evidence that I have worked under someone else, I have experience in internships and experience in a specific domain, data analysis, which significantly improved my profile. Overall, I had sent over 1200 emails throughout the journey. It was challenging, to say the least, but it all worked out in the end.
The INSEAD intern was under a professor who wanted to do research about investor behaviour in Europe post-COVID. The initial prediction was that investors would increasingly start investing in healthcare and technology after COVID-19 for multiple reasons. Multiple scholarly papers have been published that pointed to that. We wanted to ascertain those findings, find why they happened, and draw a logical chain of events between the reasons for these investors investing in specific stocks using bibliographic analysis.
Experience, Challenges, and Takeaways
Since it was an online internship, my deadlines were pretty chill. Using bibliographic analysis, we created cluster mappings that allowed us to narrow it down to about 300 research papers from the 20,000 papers we had. After that, we managed to locate specific paragraphs using the same technique that provided us with a tiny corpus we then had to go through manually and reduced our work by many folds. Keep in mind that professors know that you are a student, and the work that you have been given is also not something that will be very transformational or field specific.
Regarding personal work experience, it was slightly unfortunate that the other interns I was working with were on site, yet I was working on a virtual machine and working on the same project. But yes, we used to get on calls and converse about several things. It was definitely exciting for me to interact with people from different countries and different nationalities. And I'm hoping to follow through on a few of my promises to them to meet with them at some point in our lives. During my time as an intern I got along really well with the Professor; he was also from Delhi. He interned at McKinsey before moving to academia and gave me some advice on preparing for the internship period.
Apart from that, I'm satisfied with the work I did during my internship and how I went beyond expectations and deadlines. The professor was pleased and impressed with my work, which meant that in the future, whenever I apply for something like a master's or a PhD, I would have a good LOR to bank upon.
Personal Takeaways
The kind of interactions that we have with our batch mates, juniors, seniors, acquaintances, and friends at college is very different from something that you have in a corporate office, research, or any kind of workplace.
There is a specific manner in which you are supposed to behave; there is a certain balance of professionalism and frankness that you are supposed to have when interacting with people, which I managed to integrate within myself. This allowed me to navigate more positively with people because you are not making friends during your internships. You are socialising to a large extent. The importance of doing well in these environments and maintaining a pleasant relationship with co-workers was revealed to me during this internship.
Key Advice to Juniors
Offline foreign internships provide insights and opportunities that cannot be replicated with online internships.
While I do agree these procedures take a toll on your mental health, don't lose hope. Reach out to seniors and your friends. And just keep up the research about how you can work on your approach.
The later you apply, the less likely you are to get an internship. The environment in which you will compete gets challenging and more difficult as you get later.
Keep in mind that you should apply for domains you will likely get into. Management, Security, Machine learning/AI, LLP, and Computer Vision are all domains in which you will likely get an internship. A domain such as theoretical mathematics is one in which few research internships are available. Do a bit of research on which domains are receiving a lot of funding.

Aarushi Mittal - Benori Knowledge Limited
BSP
Sep 8, 2024
5 min read
Aarushi Mittal (ME2)
Domain: Consulting
Interned at
Benori Knowledge Limited, Gurugram
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Hemang Mathur
Introduction
Hi, I‚Äôm Aarushi Mittal. I‚Äôm a third-year student pursuing a degree in Production and Industrial Engineering. As far as my college experience goes, I have been extremely active in the Literary Club, having been a representative in my second year and a director currently. I was also a convenor in the Debating Society and a journalist at the Board for Student Publications last year. Apart from this, I‚Äôm a coordinator for the Business and Consulting Club.
So, at the beginning of second year, I had three PORs and one additional responsibility- four societies I was already somewhat committed to. On top of that, being in the Mechanical Department, I had been warned of difficult grading.
All things considered, I‚Äôd say second year was on the hectic side for me. Nonetheless, I was mostly going with the flow, not thinking too much about what I was doing.
Motivation
During the second semester, I had this long conversation with my mentor about the sort of things I should keep in mind, given the ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô road people take- intern in second year, intern in third year.
I started looking for internships actively in January, primarily research oriented. I had been told that research interns in the second years, especially in a different country, grant great exposure. I was looking for business projects surrounding operations research and optimisation. However, most of the projects I was getting did not match my interests. So, I started moving on to other options. It was about March, when I started considering a corporate intern.
Application Process
Well, it started off with cold mailing professors for research internships; and I got replies from quite a few of them, really. But, like I said, they were not matching my interests. By March, I knew I needed an intern in consulting.
Back then, the ‚Äòapplication process‚Äô simply involved going on to LinkedIn and cold mailing companies instead of professors. I knew perfectly well that most major consulting firms wouldn‚Äôt hire a second-year student, but I wasn‚Äôt after a big stipend- I was in it for the exposure and experience of working in a corporate environment. And I did get rejected quite a lot, but by the end of May I had two positive responses, one of which was from this firm.
Internship Experience
The company I worked at is called Benori Knowledge Limited. It was actually founded by an IIT Delhi alumni.
Now, I‚Äôve signed an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement), so I am not allowed to take names, but our direct client was a policy consulting company in Saudi Arabia working with the government there to ensure industrial safety and security. I worked with that client to analyse the current standards of safety in Saudi Arabia, occupational hazards involved and measures to combat said hazards. We had to do a strategy gap assessment and provide recommendations.
So what exactly was my work? It was leaning towards secondary research- secondary research meaning simply pouring over the internet and looking for pre-existing data to help you make insights on whatever the problem statement is. I worked with a few other analysts to scout through a lot of documents- financial reports, labour organisation studies, and the like.
Part of our goal was also to benchmark and compare the situation in Saudi Arabia with a number of other countries to set the standard and decide where the client had to improve.
There was a lot of PowerPoint. That‚Äôs another thing I learnt, how to make more aesthetic slides. Jokes aside, I got to learn about all sorts of technology I had no idea existed, as well as areas like AI, IOT, and so on. We gained insights into how such technologies are actually employed in the supermarket and how things work at the grassroot level. So, the research aspect was enjoyable in that sense.
As for my colleagues, I was somewhat disappointed, for lack of a better word. They weren‚Äôt exactly enthusiastic about networking and talking to each other. One of them was very shy; the others were helpful from the work side of things, but still lacking that human element I would have appreciated. They would often forget I was a second-year college student. Other than that, though, our relationships were fine- they were cordial.
The working hours were irksome- they did get me to work on holidays every now and then. It would start off with, say, an hour‚Äôs work on a Saturday, and gradually turn into me working entire days.
Takeaways
The biggest takeaway is definitely that I learnt how to manage relationships in a corporate environment- being diplomatic with people, learning to handle unfairness- stuff like that. Workplace politics is complicated. It‚Äôs not very blatant. Someone taking credit for your work, being pushed over- things like this happen very subtly and I got some valuable exposure in this regard.
One of my most pleasant memories would be occasionally meeting up with two of my friends that were also interning in Gurgaon- going out for dinner after long hours, exploring more of the city- it felt great!
For me, at least, I realised that consulting is not as glamorous as people make it out to be. There aren‚Äôt as many job opportunities as I used to think, it‚Äôs not as high paying, and it does get a bit boring.
Advice for Juniors
First thing I‚Äôll say is- I know a lot of people who did not have second year interns, and they‚Äôre doing fine. Don‚Äôt worry too much about it- the second-year intern process, in my opinion, is not meant to be stressed out over. You‚Äôll probably do decently by just going with the flow and consistently sending mails.
Secondly, if you‚Äôre absolutely determined that you want to get into consulting- yes, a second-year intern does help. I‚Äôve seen that the combination of one research and one corporate internship tends to play out pretty well for people. Brand value matters in both, though it‚Äôs not the end of the world if you‚Äôre lacking in that aspect.
Do remember, though, that the decision to go into consulting is as simple as, say, doing it because you never learnt to code, or because you aren‚Äôt interested in your core field. With the working hours and the effort that it requires, you‚Äôll only be able to do well in consulting if you‚Äôre actually interested in the work.
On a final note- learn to code. My life would have been a lot easier if I had learnt how to code during college, it helps in all sorts of ways even if you‚Äôre not inclined towards tech.
Other than that, try not to worry too much about the second-year intern- it‚Äôs definitely not the end of the world if you don‚Äôt get one, and it‚Äôll probably be vastly different from your expectations anyway (just like most things). So, simply take it easy and you‚Äôll do well.

Bharat Agarwal - NTU, Singapore
BSP
Sep 8, 2024
5 min read
Bharat Agarwal (EE1)
Domain: Research
Interned at NTU, Singapore
Mode: Online
Interviewed by: Arnav Dixit
MOTIVATION
I think the process of elimination works very well in understanding where you want to go. Once you start mailing, you will find some professors saying yes while some declining your mail. I got a couple of replies, and they were in the areas of cloud computing, bio-medical and machine learning. I thought that Machine learning in general was the subject I wanted to learn since it extends to multiple fields, especially in electrical engineering. Considering that was something I wanted to learn I thought an internship is the best way to learn a new subject. Moreover I was interested in EEG (Electroencephalography) because it is a unique field which is related to my branch as well. So it presented me with an intersection of electrical engineering and machine learning.
Considering we need to prepare for the third year OCS internships too, I preferred an online intern as offline internships are a huge time investment. So I wanted to balance both a research internship experience as well as prepare for the upcoming OCS Intern Season.
APPLICATION PROCEDURE
The procedure is pretty standard. We go and check the rankings of the colleges and check their faculty pages. After reading their profiles and their research interests, we start mailing the professors based on our interests. You can also send personalized emails to the professors with whom you are greatly interested in working.
Usually people mail 300-400 professors before getting a reply. However, I was lucky in this respect since I got 2 replies after mailing 7 professors. I started mailing in January. I do think that early beginners have better chances of getting in. So I would recommend that people start mailing around late August or early September. I got replies from the professors in January, after which I started reading research papers of the professors, which took some time. At the end of my 4th semester, the professor under whom I am currently working asked me to make a small PPT about EEG so that she could get an idea about my knowledge in this field. Also, she could get a proof of concept about how much I was invested in the project this way. In the week just after the majors, I had to read more about the subject and then I presented the PPT to her during the summer break. Afterwards, it went on pretty smoothly, and we had one meeting every two weeks.
PREPARATION
You generally do not need to prepare beforehand. Before this internship, I had no idea of machine learning. I worked mainly on neural networks and I learned everything after I started working in the internship. Regarding resources, you can always look up Andrew Ng‚Äôs courses on Machine Learning. There are also many animated videos on YouTube on convoluted neural networks. Also, you can use ChatGPT to understand specific concepts. I also started reading some research papers. Sometimes, internships can have specific requirements, like my professor asked me to learn about PyTorch, which is a Python library. As far as the theory part is concerned, I reached out to a professor in IITD to understand where I can learn about EEG from. He suggested me some PhD thesis of his students which I later studied.
WORK EXPERIENCE
I would rate my experience as an 8 out of 10. This is simply because there were a couple of things that hindered me from giving my 100%. Firstly, I had to prepare for the OCS Intern season as well. Then, since the internship was online, I did not have access to servers to get my models executed. Also you have to schedule meetings with your professors during an online internship. Luckily, my professor was very responsive. Otherwise, the internship was very insightful and I got to learn about many new things. I worked on RNNs and SVMs. I also got to use a model of a professor from NTU and worked on achieving better results by slightly changing the model and hyperparameters. So that was a very fortunate opportunity.
My expectation from the internship was that I would have to work really hard, and probably I would have to learn too much. However, this was not really the case. It‚Äôs not like they will give you some novel thing to discover. Instead, they go slow so that you can catch up. I initially had some doubts regarding my prior knowledge in this field. How does EEG work? How does deep learning work? But I think under the supervision and guidance of a professor, it is always easy to learn as the process continues.
CHALLENGES
There are some difficulties in an online internship. For example, machine learning algorithms take a lot of time to be executed. So we can‚Äôt run them on normal laptops and require specialized computers which can do parallel programming. So if this was an offline internship, I would have server access to actually run my code on these computers. Secondly, learning new things can come across as challenging. Professors can guide you, but in the end, you have to do the learning part yourself. The professor will give you a topic and you have to figure out everything about it yourself. These are pretty much all the challenges I faced during the internship.
LEARNINGS AND INSIGHTS
One of my biggest takeaways from this experience is the importance of good resource hunting. When you have zero knowledge about a particular domain, then it is imperative to reach out to the right people and study from the right places which is something that I learnt here. Also, this was a very insightful period for me. Now, I know that I don‚Äôt want to pursue a role in deep tech spaces where we build things; instead, I want to pursue an analyst role where I can understand and study the features and find out patterns. So, during the upcoming OCS intern process, I am more willing to take up a product analyst or product management role rather than a deep tech role.
TIPS TO JUNIORS
If you know that you are interested in something, then try to take up an internship in the same domain. When you start applying for an internship, many professors would not reply. So, I think it is not right to compromise on your field of interest just because you are getting positive replies from somebody else. Secondly, use this opportunity to learn. If you don‚Äôt have anything to do in the summer, try research internships to explore newer fields that you are interested in. This will also help you in gaining knowledge about different things. So, start applying early, understand your interests and reach out to maximum people.

Kshitij Agarwal - Vetmeduni, Vienna
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024
3 min read
Kshitij Agarwal (BB1)
Interned at Vetmeduni, Vienna
Domain: Research - Computational Biology
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Rayna Maheshwari
MOTIVATION
I had done two internships in my first year in IIT Delhi. The first one was in summers of the first year under Prof. Aditya Mittal‚Äôs lab SCFBio
at IIT Delhi. The second intern was during 4th ¬†semester which was a remote one in Business from University of Cambridge. After my first internship I was quite interested in academia and especially in biotechnology. Hence I decided to go ahead with a research intern in biotechnology. I especially wanted it to be a foreign intern so that I could get cultural exposure.
APPLICATION PROCEDURE
I went and searched for the World QS ranking. Then I found the faculty of the university and read about their projects. Finally, I started emailing them my CV and cover letter. I introduced many informal things in my cover letter to make it sound friendly to the professors to show them that I'm eagerly interested in working with them. I also wrote personalized mails to every Professor whom I was approaching.
PREPARATION
There was a certain approach which I went with while applying¬† for foreign internship.
I had gotten an LOR for my summer project, as well as from an IIT professor,which I think boosted my profile.I made a very neat and clean CV and personalized my cover letter for every single professor. I think what worked out for me was having a lab experience beforehand. In the mails I used to talk about the professor‚Äôs research project and their research papers whichI believe stood out to the professors.
WORK EXPERIENCE
The work experience was amazing.I had to report to the office by 9:30-10 am and I was working there till 5 pm. I had Friday meetings with my professor and the rest of the time I was in my lab particularly. I was working with around four to five people in totality. Though the work environment was quite intriguing but weekly journal hours and academic paper discussion were something which I looked out for.
We had snacks in our lab. It was like a house. At 12:30 we had our lunch in a common kitchen. There was a kitchen with all the supplies and we used to prepare our own meals together. Post our lunch we used to go for a relaxing walk for 10-15 minutes and then come back again and work for three or four more hours. At approximately 5-6 PM people started leaving the office. After that I used to explore the city in the first month. In the second month I was preparing for my OCS internship.
CHALLENGES
I lived in Vienna alone for two months and worked on a project. And even though it was a group project, the task I was assigned was something which I had to do alone without seeking help. In fact living alone, cooking alone, managing everything was definitely taxing. Moreover, while exploring few major cities of Europe during my internship for the two months. I found out a lot about myself too. I realized that there are a lot of things which I thought I would like but ended up not liking and vice-versa.
LEARNINGS AND INSIGHTS
My biggest takeaway is probably the foreign lab environment as it's something which could be experienced only on site. Moreover working with some like-minded people from all over the world was definitely an impressive experience.The exposure which I got was worth the efforts which I had put into getting the internship. I would say on the professional front, I had a Foreign intern on my CV which helped me get a shortlist and finally secure my third year intern.
TIPS TO JUNIORS
I would suggest starting the process early. Make a good and clean CV. Take help from your seniors and make sure you try to get an LOR from a professor as it adds brownie points to your CV. Finally try to be passionate while writing your emails as professors get many emails from students so there should be something to differentiate you from the crowd.

Rahul Masand - SURA
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024
3 min read
Rahul Masand (CH7)
Domain: Research (SURA)- Goniometer
Interned at IIT Delhi
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Rishit Srivastava
INTRODUCTION
I‚Äôm Rahul, and I'm currently in my second year of a dual degree in Chemical Engineering. My hobbies include debating and mostly reading.
MOTIVATION
How did you get to know about SURA/ what was the motivation behind pursuing it?
I had a very random interaction with my Fluid Mechanics professor, Dr. Somnath Basu. We met on a staircase, which led to a discussion about the lack of equipment manufacturing in India. I asked if he would help us create something, and he encouraged me to apply for SURA under his guidance. I had no clue about lab equipment at that time, but this opportunity seemed interesting, so I went for it.
APPLICATION PROCESS
What was the application process for SURA was like?
SURA is a program where the institute shortlists students who have a CGPA of 7.5 or above and willing to apply for a research project under the guidance of a professor, either individually or in teams of 2. After preparing a proposal, you present it to your department‚Äôs committee, which consists of senior professors. They review your proposal, question its feasibility, and ask what you aim to achieve. If selected, your job is to fulfill what you promised in your proposal.
INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE
What was your Internship (SURA) about, like what all did you work on in your SURA?
My SURA project involved building a contact angle goniometer, a device used in surface chemistry to measure contact angles and hysteresis. This tool has multiple applications, especially in biotech and chemical labs. The challenge was to create this equipment under a budget of ‚Çπ25,000 with accuracy comparable to those available in the Indian market, which typically cost around ‚Çπ4-5 lakhs.
What were the challenges you faced during your Internship?
The major challenge was the cost reduction. Typically, a goniometer costs around ‚Çπ20 lakhs if imported, or ‚Çπ4-5 lakhs if manufactured in India, albeit with lower accuracy. Our task was to develop this instrument for under ‚Çπ25,000 while maintaining accuracy close to industry standards.
We faced challenges at every step, from figuring out the hardware and software components to achieving precision in the camera and stage automation. It required a lot of research and innovation, especially since we were aiming for industry-grade precision within a highly constrained budget. But overall, the experience was incredibly rewarding as it pushed us to explore and innovate beyond traditional methods.
What do you think are the exclusive benefits SURA provides you?/ Why should one go for SURA?
Firstly, with SURA, the entire institute is trusting you by providing faculty mentorship. The professors mentoring you are highly experienced, often dedicating several hours to your project. This kind of mentorship goes beyond classroom lectures; you get access to their offices, labs, and valuable resources, including connections outside the institute.
Additionally, SURA can lead to further opportunities like publishing research papers or even patents. I have friends whose SURA projects are on their way to becoming patents. The support and experience you gain through SURA can be invaluable.
LEARNINGS
Any advice/ learnings for the incoming second yearites who shall be applying for internships this year.
Firstly, I would advise everyone to try a research internship at least once. It‚Äôs important on your CV, and it‚Äôs easier to secure than a corporate internship, especially if you lack connections or a high CGPA. A research internship can help you understand if you want to pursue a particular field further.
For those interested in sectors like business analytics, learning some coding and applying to top business schools for internships can be beneficial. It‚Äôs not about giving up corporate aspirations but rather gaining clarity on your interests.
As for selection criteria, your CGPA doesn‚Äôt always matter for research internships, except for programs like SURA. Many students with CGPAs as low as 6.0 have secured good research internships abroad by being diligent with their applications. Timing and persistence in sending out emails are crucial. If you‚Äôre applying abroad, sending emails at the right time in the professor‚Äôs local time zone can increase your chances of getting a response. Lastly, don't stress too much about having a fixed career path in the second year‚Äîexploration is key.

Parth Verma - University College London
BSP
Sep 8, 2024

Parth Verma (CS1)
Domain: Quantitative Finance (Sentimental Analysis)
Interned at University College London
Mode: Online
Interviewed by: Ahilaan Saxena
Introduction
I am Parth Verma, I am from the Computer Science Department. I interned remotely under Professor Philp Treleaven of UCL (University College London) during summer vacations at the end of my 2nd Year. The internship was based on quantitative finance and mainly involved sentimental analysis of stocks, i.e., analysing the market sentiment about a stock with the help of related tweets.
Motivation
I chose to intern in this field because of my background in Mathematics and Computer Science and the vast bundle of opportunities this field offers. I did not have much significant knowledge about the subject. Nor do the professors expect a vast skill set for 2nd-year interns. A good CG and academic achievements like a good JEE Rank and Olympiad qualifications are enough to secure a good research internship.
Application Process
Beginning in September, I started sending out a couple of cold emails daily to professors from CS institutes all around the world with my CV and explaining why they should pick me for the internship. An excellent place to find a list of the top CS institutions is
csranking.com
. Out of every hundred emails I sent, I received around 7-8 replies. Some of them even took more than a month. Every professor has a different process. Some provide a direct response, while others conduct an interview. Prof. Treleaven, however, did not take any interviews.
Internship Experience
In December, Mr Treleaven finalised our team of four‚Äîthree from IIT Delhi and one from IIT Roorkee. He provided us with reference material on sentiment analysis and asked us to source datasets related to stocks from the web. We acquired datasets for Amazon and Tesla stocks. We examined current methods and various libraries used for sentiment analysis. Our approach involved analysing tweets to determine whether consumers felt bullish or bearish about a stock by assigning scores to each word and performing calculations based on those scores using custom dictionaries. At one point, we noticed that the tweets indicated unusually bearish sentiment. To address this issue, we manually adjusted the scaling of the negative tweets. Although the internship was remote and did not provide a stipend, it was an incredibly enriching experience that offered valuable insights into Machine Learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
Getting an LOR or not largely depends on your relationship with the professor. You should request it; in most cases, they will be happy to provide it. However, if you haven't worked diligently during your internship, the professor may deny you a certificate of completion.
Advice to Juniors
Besides the process I described earlier, you could also apply for a project under a professor at IIT Delhi during the semester or winter break, which is relatively easy to get. Completing such a project makes securing a research internship abroad much easier due to the relevant experience you have gained from these projects. Additionally, including assignments and projects you have done as a part of IITD courses in your CV can also be beneficial.

Shourya Vir Jain - 360one
BSP
Sep 8, 2024
5 min read
Shourya Vir Jain (EE3)
Domain: Product Development
Interned at 360one, Mumbai
Mode: Offline
Interviewed by: Prasoon Raj
Introduction
Hi, I am Shourya Vir Jain from EE3. I love playing chess, and I serve as the Institute's current Chess Captain and ex-Vice Captain. Additionally, I am an incoming McKinsey intern.
Motivation for Internship
Near the end of 2nd year, I still needed to set a concrete plan for a second-year internship. I returned to Bombay to spend time with my family but wasn't actively looking for an intern. I was planning to take the summer off and relax. I had already interned in the winter with the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water (CEEW) because I was interested in energy science then. The same applied to this internship‚Äîit happened to be in a sector that interested me, particularly AI/ML in finance.
I was working on a project with my friend through my 2nd year. We were building an AI-based data discoverability tool. While searching for product-market fit, we contacted various financial sector players. One was 360one, a wealth and asset management firm based in Bombay. As we were trying to pitch our product to them, the CTO liked our technology and invited us to integrate it into their system. That's how I ended up doing a two-month internship during the summer break. It wasn't pre-planned but was more of an opportunity that arose during our project work.
Experience: Work, Challenges and Learnings
I was part of the wealth technology team at 360one. We were given three open-ended problem statements focusing on building systems for their wealth spectrum operations.
One of the projects involved creating a recommendation engine to help 360one expand its network of distributors for its mutual funds. We analysed their data and built this engine over two months. Another project was a data discoverability tool to help fund managers find relevant insights from internal research and reports. The last was building retrospective customer service analytics using a massive corpus of ticket data.
Challenges
It was challenging at times, but the environment was supportive. We had regular touchpoints with the VPs and some senior managers, who were exceptionally helpful when we needed advice or feedback. The entrepreneurial spirit of the place helped us think on our feet and adapt quickly. The responsibility was huge; it was more than just regular intern tasks. We were given problem statements that had real implications for the company, and that responsibility made us push ourselves further. We reported directly to the CTO; she was a bustling absolute powerhouse. But because of her schedule, she wasn't always available for daily check-ins or detailed guidance. This was both a boon and a bane.
On the one hand, it gave us a lot of freedom. We enjoyed the freedom of not reporting every day to anyone. Of course, that came with its challenges‚Äîespecially ensuring that the work was up to the standards expected by the top brass.
Learnings
I had planned to sit for a third-year internship. By the middle of the internship, it became clear, especially after interacting with many professionals, that I wanted to go in the consulting direction. Even though I had choices in Tech and other streams, the experience at 360one and the stories from the people I worked with were impactful and helped shape my decision. It made me realise the importance of adaptability and managing high expectations, especially in environments where you're given freedom but are also expected to deliver impactful results. It also gave me insights into how data is handled in large corporations, particularly in privacy and security, which are vital in consulting and Tech. I think these lessons helped shape how I approached the internship process in my third year, knowing I wanted to be in roles that challenged me and allowed for strategic input.
Why jump from Tech to Consult?
That's an exciting story. I've been coding and doing tech development since the 11th or 12th grade‚Äîhackathons, building products, coding full-scale projects. By the time I reached my third year, I had already built and sold a product, so I felt I already had a decent flavour of software tech. It started with the experience of building a GenAI-based research tool for the research ecosystem. My friend and I spent three months working on it, winning hackathons, and securing grants, but when we pitched it to actual professors, we were shot down with the justification, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not how actual research works‚Äô. During this time, I learned an important lesson: Knowing your consumer's needs before building anything is crucial. It was a three-month period filled with relentless commitment and hard work, prompting a reassessment of my problem-solving strategies. That's when consulting started to appeal to me.
Consulting, I realised, teaches you to ask the right questions, understand user needs, and identify actual market problems. I was attracted to that broader perspective instead of the linear depth of tech development.
Consulting provides a wide-angle view of industries, which helps identify real-world problems. I also had excellent mentors at 360one that showed me the power of consulting‚Äîgrit, strategy, and leadership. The brand value of consulting firms is something we often undervalue. Much like IIT Delhi opens doors in certain situations, consulting firms carry significant weight regarding career progression. They provide opportunities like deferred MBAs and international exposure, which appealed to me.
Also, My personality aligns more with a front-end role where I talk to people and manage communication. It's a skill I wanted to develop more than coding, which I was already good at. I focused on honing my interpersonal and problem-solving skills, and consulting seemed the perfect fit.
Key Takeaway & Advice
The biggest reason 99% of students from IIT Delhi don't land an internship in their second year is that they're afraid to reach out. They fear sending that email or message and then facing rejection. But honestly, every opportunity I've had so far began as a shot in the dark.
There was no concrete reason why I should have been selected for these roles. More qualified people were out there, but the critical difference was that I reached out. Many juniors hesitate to contact companies, whether for an internship or a research project. But at the end of the day, you're from IIT Delhi. You should have that baseline confidence in yourself, knowing you can learn on the job. Even if you still need to get all the skills upfront, it doesn't matter. What's more important is that you shoot your shot.
Once you get an opportunity, go in confidently, learn like crazy, work 12-15 hours daily if needed, and push yourself. There's nothing you can't know if you're committed.
Another advice would be to feel free to leverage your network. Whether reaching out to alumni on LinkedIn or using personal connections, it's all part of the game. If your relative knows someone who can help you land an internship, don't feel ashamed to use that connection. It's just as valid a way to get an internship as any other method.
One more thing ‚Äì learn how to tell your story. When you're sending out those cold emails, be unique. A well-crafted cold email can make all the difference. Many resources online, like YouTube, can teach you how to write an effective email. And trust me, coming from IIT Delhi, you'll get responses if you reach out enough. It's a numbers game ‚Äì send 50 emails, you'll get one response, and that's all you need to land a great offer.
Lastly, apply to roles you're genuinely interested in. Don't just apply for the sake of applying.

Ashmit Nangia - IvyCap
BSP IIT Delhi
Sep 8, 2024
3 min read
Ashmit Nangia (EE1)
Domain: Investment Analyst
Interned at IvyCap
Mode: Online
Interviewed by: Rishit Srivastava
INTRODUCTION
I‚Äôm Ashmit, currently in my third year, pursuing Electrical Engineering. Apart from academics, I‚Äôm actively involved in debating, playing tennis, and I‚Äôm a huge cricket fan. I‚Äôm based out of Delhi.
Could you briefly explain your internship role and what exactly you worked on?
I interned with IvyCap, a venture capital firm, as an Investment Analyst in their Portfolio Management Division. My role involved working with several companies that IvyCap had invested in, helping them grow their revenue and profitability. This was done by analysing industry practices, identifying what these companies were struggling with, and providing solutions to bolster their performance.
MOTIVATION
What motivated you to pursue a second-year internship in this field?
After my first-year internship with EY in consulting, I wanted to explore something different before fully committing to consulting in my third year. I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in a tech internship, so I decided to try something in the investing space. This was suggested by some seniors, and it seemed like a good way to explore a new domain and see if it might be a future career path for me.
APPLICATION PROCESS
Can you walk us through the timeline of your application process and how you secured this internship?
I started by reaching out to IIT Delhi alumni working in the investing space through LinkedIn. I researched the top VCs in India and connected with people working there, sending out my resume and a cover letter. I sent emails to about 10 VCs, contacting 5-6 people per VC. Around March, I initially secured an internship with IvyCap in a different role related to EVs (Electric Vehicle Systems), but that project got shelved. I was then transferred to the Portfolio Management Division after another round of interviews. It was a remote internship, so I didn‚Äôt need to relocate.
INTERNSHIP PROCESS
Many students are in the process of applying for their second-year internships. What advice would you give them on building a strong resume and cover letter?
Resume:
Your resume should tell a cohesive story. It shouldn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôve just dabbled in random activities. There should be a clear progression that shows growth and focus.
Formatting is crucial. Important points, such as the companies you‚Äôve worked with and the impact you‚Äôve created, should stand out.
Organise your achievements in order of relevance to the role you‚Äôre applying for.
Cover Letter:
Your cover letter should complement your resume by explaining your story in more detail. It‚Äôs where you can talk about your motivation and elaborate on experiences that don‚Äôt fit into bullet points on your resume.
Personalise your cover letter as much as possible. Mention specific projects or aspects of the company that interest you. This shows that you‚Äôve done your research and are genuinely interested in the role.
LEARNINGS
What was the most interesting part of your internship, and how do you think it helped you evolve?
The most interesting part was definitely the exposure to different industries. I didn‚Äôt know much about influencer marketing before this internship, but through secondary research, white papers, and conversations with startup founders, I gained a lot of knowledge. This experience of gathering and applying information from diverse fields was invaluable.
Another significant aspect was the opportunity to present my findings to senior executives, including the CEO of the portfolio management division. This helped me develop better communication and presentation skills, which have been crucial in my subsequent experiences, including my third-year internship process. It taught me how to organize my thoughts and present them clearly and concisely to high-level stakeholders.
ADVICE
Finally, do you have any general advice for second-year students about their internship search and how they should approach it?
Focus on the learning experience rather than just the brand name or the internship itself. It‚Äôs important to choose an internship in a domain that interests you or that you want to explore rather than just trying to get any internship. This experience is about building your foundation, not just filling out your resume.
Also, don‚Äôt worry too much about the internship process. It‚Äôs not as daunting as it seems. Most companies are looking for a willingness to learn and basic problem-solving skills, which you can showcase with a willingness to learn. So, start early, stay focused on your learning goals, and don‚Äôt stress out!

Parth, Suren, Tejas, Vaibhav, Kushagra - INRIA, France
BSP
Nov 8, 2023
6 min read
Parth, Suren, Tejas (ABS Team), Vaibhav, and Kushagra (Titane Team)
Summer Internship at INRIA, France
What inspired you to take up a research internship?
Kushagra
- I have always been interested in geometry and math since high school. Research has also interested me a lot, and I had always wanted to give it a try.
Vaibhav
- I had completed a Machine Learning course through Coursera, which piqued my interest further, and I wanted to explore it in depth.
Did you consider applying for SURA?
Since SURA was announced rather late, all of us had already secured internships by then, so we did not consider applying. INRIA's research environment is not significantly different from SURA's, but INRIA offers more flexibility and a greater scope for social development.
Were you drawn to the internship because of the topic or the research involved?
Suren
- I was not particularly inclined toward any specific topic. I wanted to try out research and have always preferred the theoretical side of Computer Science over the practical side.
Vaibhav
- I was asked to read the professor's research papers, which helped me become familiar with the topic at hand.
Kushagra
- I would advise not to be hesitant and avoid any area just because it is highly competitive.
Parth
- One must try internships that require courses that have already been covered. This doesn't require too much background; otherwise, it may take a long time to become familiar with the topic at hand.
Is there a luck factor involved?
Everyone agreed that luck plays a role.
Kushagra
- Targeted emailing and knowing the experiences of previous interns help reduce the luck factor.
Parth
- I emailed five or six professors after reading the abstracts of their research papers, which helped me receive a few positive responses.
Tejas
- There was a message shared on WhatsApp groups about a possible internship under a professor. Luckily, I paid attention to it and then told Suren about it. The ABS team had received many competitive applications. After Suren and I applied, only two positions were left. Word spreads quickly, so it's important to stay in touch with your seniors.
Did you specifically prepare for the internship?
Vaibhav
- I completed a course on Coursera. Since my work in the internship was a continuation of previous research, I also reviewed the earlier work.
Suren
- The professor sent me some reading material about the recent developments in my field of research.
Kushagra
- I watched the professor's YouTube videos and simulations to understand my topic better.
Parth:
My professor sent me short videos on bioinformatics algorithms.
Would you all now introduce your research problems please?
Kushagra:
My work involved computational geometry. I was tasked with improving the CGAL algorithm related to alpha shapes and generating a specific type of 3-D mesh wrap for a given model, which is used in various geometry processing and graphics applications. I improved the complexity and performance by adding another parameter tolerance to stop subsequent refinement based on suitable approximation.
Vaibhav
- I worked on a sub-project as part of the larger BIM2TWIN project. The aim of my project was to classify different objects in LiDAR point clouds using Deep Learning models. This has potential applications in automated progress monitoring of construction sites.
Parth
- My work was on hierarchical clustering. I was given a set of RNA databases extracted from different parts of the world. My task was to develop a tree to identify the parent and child COVID samples. I managed to develop new heuristic algorithms that greatly improved time complexity.
Tejas
- I worked on the sampling of proteins with multiple loops. My aim was to generate conformations of biological proteins efficiently, and I implemented an algorithm in C++ to achieve this.
Suren
- My work was part of an ongoing project. The previous intern was developing a clustering algorithm. My task was to fix a loophole in the algorithm regarding an optimization method, which was not guaranteed to work, even if it did in practice.
What was the size of the team that you worked in, and to what extent did you experience collaboration?
The general consensus was that the team typically consisted of a head professor, senior researchers, post-doctorates, and interns. These individuals were very knowledgeable and helpful. The supervisors, who were senior researchers and post-doctorates, provided substantial support during the internship.
As the internship progressed, did you notice any difference between reality and your expectations beforehand?
Parth
- I was initially nervous and determined to meet the professor's expectations. However, the professor and supervisors turned out to be very friendly and did not hold unrealistic expectations.
Vaibhav
- I expected a smoother experience, but at times, small issues escalated into bigger problems during my internship.
Suren
- My experience was better than expected. The professors did not expect second-year undergraduates to know everything. I had the opportunity to interact with people from multiple teams, which allowed me to learn about many active fields of research in Mathematics and Computer Science.
Kushagra
- I attended multiple seminars and workshops, which was a great learning experience for me.
If professors do not expect a lot from undergraduate students, what do they expect?
Professors believe that intern students are sharp at effectively implementing algorithms. There is also an element of demand and supply at play. They also look for interns who could potentially become PhD candidates.
How were the professors? Did they encourage you to pursue higher studies?
Professors often seek PhD students. They helped us prioritise and provided key insights about career decisions. Independent thinking was also encouraged. The supervisors frequently shared their past research experiences and what they would do differently if given the choice to start over. Overall, it was a healthy environment and a welcome change from the IIT Delhi campus.
What skills did you acquire during the internship?
Suren
- Besides the academic experience, I realised that I lacked in collaborative efforts. I also learned to write cleaner code, as the professor pointed out.
Tejas
- I improved my presentation skills and significantly enhanced my LaTeX and C++ coding skills.
Kushagra
- I learned new things in the field of topology and algorithms and gained respect for other research fields as well.
Vaibhav
- I improved my communication skills by engaging with a variety of people. In my branch, there are no collaborative assignments, so it was a refreshing change and a great experience.
How does an offline internship compare with an online one?
If research experience were only about academics, there wouldn't be much difference between an online and offline internship. An offline internship offers great potential for social development, teaching you how to maintain professional relationships and adapt to work culture. You are not always bombarded with work, and there is greater appreciation for your efforts. An offline internship is also a good way to convince your parents for a vacation. We visited neighbouring countries like Monaco, Switzerland, Italy, and Vatican City for sightseeing, an experience not possible in an online internship.
Were the submissions and deadlines quite challenging?
Kushagra and Vaibhav - We worked from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. with two hours for lunch. We had only two strict deadlines and occasional presentations. The internship offered significant flexibility. In our free time, we enjoyed playing in the music room and having fun.
Tejas - Professors did not expect us to work after 5 P.M.
How was the internship experience in general?
Vaibhav
- The provided accommodation was quite good, with a clean microwave, weekly room service, and subsidised food. The academic experience was significantly different from what we were used to at IIT Delhi.
Kushagra
- Here, we often rush to complete courses and assignments. At INRIA, the pace was slower, allowing us to apply the topics better and with less stress.
What was the most memorable thing about the internship for you?
Kushagra
- The tourist experience was great. Despite being a vegetarian, I managed to find good food. We also interacted with students from IIT Bombay and IIT Kanpur and learned about their campus culture. We made many new friends as well.
Vaibhav
- The evening coffee breaks were memorable. We discussed our research problems and cultures. There was a Dutch post-doctorate who had great knowledge about Indian history, leading to insightful discussions on philosophy and ethics.
Finally, what advice would you give to intern hopefuls?
Suren
- There is no right time to start contacting professors. It's better to begin as soon as possible. Use websites like csrankings.org to identify professors based on your interests. You are not expected to have an in-depth knowledge of their research papers, so don't be discouraged from applying to a subject. Don't hesitate to contact professors, and don't expect any prerequisites.
Tejas and Kushagra
- Specifically for dual-degree students, if you plan to pursue a third-year research internship, it's advisable to take your second-year research internship seriously and aim for a publication or a letter of recommendation. For BTech students, there's little time between completing a second-year internship and the third-year internship tests. Allocate about 1.5 - 2 hours every day during the summer to prepare. During the application process, consider taking relevant courses to stand out. Focus on your institute courses as well, as there's limited time for additional courses.

Mitali Nanda - Helmholtz Center for Information Security
BSP
Nov 8, 2023

Mitali Nanda (EP)
Interned at CISPA- Helmholtz Centre for Information Security
Domain: Research in Noise Modelling of Atomic Clocks
Introduction
I am a current 3rd year EP student from Delhi. I interned at the CISPA- Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. My internship at CISPA delved into noise modelling of atomic clocks under clock synchronisation. It involved statistical work, data modelling, and analysing the accuracy of assumptions in the utilised models. The project had an intersection between physics and computer science.
Motivation
Research has always intrigued me, and the internship allowed me to explore this field. It helped me discern whether research aligns with my career aspirations. In my second year, I was pursuing Engineering Physics, and I desired to blend my interests in physics and computer science. The prospect of exploring a program based in Germany with a focus on projects related to atomic clocks caught my attention. This particular subject intrigued me, as it was a fusion of both fields I was passionate about. The opportunity to delve deeper into the theories of atomic clocks, a concept I had encountered in my physics courses and labs, but from a computer science perspective, was exhilarating.
Application Process
I didn't mail much for my internship; I preferred applying through programs as the process was much more streamlined. Programs have a set procedure for application and selection, which I felt more comfortable with. My quest for this opportunity began with an online repository that listed various programs. Among these, I came across a program at CISPA that was explicitly meant for South Asians, which instantly caught my eye.
For the application, I submitted the usual prerequisites - a motivation letter, my CV, academic transcripts, and a reference from a professor. The deadline for the application was a potential hiccup. It was January 15, a notably late date for an application deadline, considering that complex visa processes had to be undertaken and responses regarding selection would only be communicated in March. This short window made the visa process slightly challenging.
One notable aspect was the requirement for a professor's recommendation letter. Here, the trick wasn't about seeking a specific reference deeply tied to the project but rather about finding someone who could vouch for my academic prowess. In my case, I approached a professor from a second-year course, someone I had frequently interacted with, who offered me a solid academic recommendation.
I didn't undergo a formal interview for the internship. After applying, I contacted my professor in January, who responded positively to my application and said he liked my profile. Although I did not initiate an interview, it's advisable to contact the professor via email post-portal application, which demonstrates genuine interest and dedication beyond mere application submission.
There weren't significant hiccups in the application. Still, the deadline and the visa process could certainly be an area of concern for future applicants, as even though my professor had said he liked my application, the formal letter of acceptance arrived in March.
Preparation
They know that if you're a second-year bachelor's student, you only have a little prior knowledge, especially a deep understanding of any subject. They don't expect that from you. They ask you to read up about the project sufficiently to get through the entire internship period. You can read up on different topics and learn more about them yourself.
Upon confirmation of my placement in the program, I found myself in a rare scenario where pre-internship groundwork was absent. The internship protocols in Germany demand a signed contract before any engagement in work. Hence, my preparations began upon arrival in Germany, offering unexpected free time beforehand.
Expectations for preliminary work or preparatory studies were minimal, as the professor explicitly stated work assignments once the contract was signed. The initial focus was not on research but on familiarising myself with Germany, its culture, and its language. The foremost challenge was the language barrier, as communication primarily involved the German language. Overcoming this discrepancy was gradual, adapting through a mix of broken German and gestures.
The Internship Experience:
Upon initiating the internship, the overarching experience unfolded over the course of eight to ten weeks in a well-structured yet relaxed manner. I was introduced to the intricacies of this research project under the guidance of a PhD student. Despite the independent nature of my project, I received commendable advice from the PhD student, which significantly streamlined my progress. The onset of the internship was marked by an informal gathering where I was introduced to my professor and the PhD student. This congenial initiation eased the transition into the formal work environment. Subsequently, the atmosphere transpired into a professional setup where I was encouraged to approach the professor or the PhD student for discussions and guidance whenever needed. Their assistance provided invaluable insights and directions for the project.
My PhD advisor was incredibly supportive. I often visited his office with queries. Although our offices were a few buildings apart, I worked in the flex office close to my professors' groups. If we saw each other, we'd occasionally have casual, insightful conversations during lunch, discussing everything from group activities to politics and healthcare. I initially worked alone in my research group. While there were supposed to be interns from Iran and other places, they started later. Towards the end, more interns joined, and we had a great time together.
The journey was a dynamic mix of literature study, data analysis, coding, and thorough discussions. I was encouraged to seek resources and scholarly materials recommended by the PhD student to facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This amalgamation of self-study and hands-on work assisted in comprehending the theoretical concepts I had encountered earlier and understanding their practical applications in the research realm. The work environment was relatively flexible and lenient, with minimal stringent deadlines. This environment was particularly beneficial for my second-year Bachelor's level expertise. It allowed me to immerse myself in the field without unnecessary pressure or time constraints. It provided a conducive learning environment, fostering an understanding of the subjects and allowing me to comprehend the work at my own pace. Challenges were prevalent, especially when grappling with new concepts that had yet to be covered extensively in my academic courses. The steepest learning curve was overcoming these new, unfamiliar topics and ensuring that I was on the right track. Navigating these uncharted waters took patience, persistence, and a continuous cycle of self-evaluation and guidance from the PhD student.
One notable incident involved a roadblock toward the completion of the project. Toward the end of my tenure, an expected result became inconclusive due to contrasting findings in the hypothesis tests. It was a significant challenge that needed resolution. However, the PhD student's guidance and encouragement to tackle complex problems in the research field were particularly valuable, as they enlightened me on the inherent uncertainties and detours research might encounter. Regrettably, post-internship continuity with the project was impeded by my academic commitments and the PhD student's obligations. Nonetheless, the overall internship tenure provided an illuminating, hands-on encounter with the intricacies of research. It was not just a professional journey but also a personally enriching experience, fostering growth on multiple fronts.
Amid the academic rigour of the German internship, I discovered several enjoyable and enriching experiences beyond scholarly pursuits. Exploring the European lifestyle was a highlight, offering glimpses into various cultures and architectural wonders. Solo trips to places like Paris and Strasbourg unveiled diverse experiences and histories that fostered personal and academic growth. Encounters with different locales broadened my perspective and nurtured a profound understanding of global nuances. Experiencing various cultures went beyond relaxation; it was a conduit for enlightenment, weaving a vivid tapestry of insights and learnings.
Key Takeaways and Learnings:
1.
Independence and Adaptability
: The experience ingrained in me the resilience and adaptability needed to navigate a new environment independently. It taught me to embrace and learn from cultural differences and language barriers, fostering personal growth.
2. Research and Academic Understanding
: This internship deepened my understanding of the research process, demonstrating how it's okay not to achieve expected results and how to learn from those experiences. The hands-on engagement taught me more than theoretical knowledge could ever encapsulate.
3. Holistic Growth:
It wasn't just academic but also about embracing life experiences. Travelling, exploring, and embracing different cultures added a new dimension to my academic pursuit.
Advice to Juniors:
For those seeking similar opportunities or contemplating a research internship, I'd like to offer some advice:
1. Open-mindedness
: Embrace new experiences. Research internships provide exposure to diverse facets. Even if it seems theoretical or different from what you're accustomed to, it's a chance to explore, learn, and grow.
2. Persistence and Resilience
: The application process might be arduous, and results may take time. Stay persistent, send regular follow-ups, and continue to build your profile with relevant experiences.
3. Preparation is Key
: Before starting your internship, request reading materials or suggested resources from your mentor. This will better equip you for the tasks ahead.
4. Engage with Advisors:
Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek help from your advisors. Open communication and discussions can significantly aid your understanding of the subject matter.
5. Embrace Unexpected Outcomes:
Research only sometimes leads to anticipated results. Don't be disheartened; it's part of the learning curve. Embrace the unexpected outcomes and use them as learning opportunities.
6. Stay Open to Research:
The internship experience might pave the way for a future in research. Keep an open mind; it might ignite a passion or change in your career trajectory.

Mrigank Singh - Wipro Linecraft AI
BSP
Nov 8, 2023

Mrigank Singh (AM1)
ML Internship at IISc
Tech Internship at Wipro Linecraft AI
Motivation:
Given that I just had a year of studying my subjects, I figured that core might not be something I wanted to pursue. So then I figured I should try my hand at various things, so that I might find something I like.
I first considered SURA. I applied for it too, but I withdrew at the last minute, right before my presentation. The reason I didn't move forward with it was that SURA is a big investment to make: it involved staying in Delhi throughout the summer, and the professor had told me that it was going to be intense, not to mention, most people who do SURA still keep working on it after the summer. More importantly, I wanted to explore different things, and I also wanted to do some amount of preparation for the incoming third-year intern season. So, I decided I'd follow the usual off-campus internship trend.
Process of Application:
I picked up my strategy internship at IISc in January. Towards the end of December, I was just scrolling through LinkedIn and figured it looked interesting. It was a strategy internship at IISc. I was thinking of picking up some project under a professor here ( at IIT Delhi), but then I thought, let's just go outside. That was the first time I made a resume. IISc got back to me a week later and scheduled a couple of rounds of interviews. The first one was like a case study, and a very general one too, be it about design, legislation, or even perception and PR. The second interview was with the project lead and was filled with standard questions: What do you expect? What do you think about it? A week later, I heard that I was selected. It was a steady internship and wasn't too hectic, and I had regular meetings with my professor and the project lead who was studying there.
The IISc internship would end in May, so for the summer, I thought I would try something in tech this time. So, I applied to a startup called Linecraft, which Wipro had acquired. I was in Pune for the summer.
I came across this company because my dad read about it on MoneyControl. I went on LinkedIn, read up about it, found the HR, and messaged her a couple of times. Luckily, this lead worked out for me. I had a round with some engineers over there. It was about coding, just the basics, and some DSA, a little about sorting and related things. I had done COL106, so the round seemed pretty easy afterwards. Then I had an HR round with standard questions such as 'Why this company?',  'Why machine learning?' and ‚ÄòWhy do you want to get this internship?‚Äô This entire process was pretty different from the conventional route that most people wherein they send 300-400 emails. I never did that.
Pre-Internship Preparations, Apprehensions, and Perceptions
As far as preparation went, I reached out to Linecraft and asked them if there was something I had to do before I came to Pune. There were a few lectures on YouTube that they asked me to watch. So that's what I did. It wasn't too much, say ten lectures of an hour each. They just wanted me to have a basic idea about coding and Python, as machine learning mostly happens in Python.
Experience, Challenges, and Takeaways:
My project at IISc was about eVTOLs: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing vehicles. My internship was centred on trying to analyse the Indian market and see where eVTOLs could be made applicable, the kinds of laws in India that would support them or create a hindrance, possible challenges and what kind of reception they would receive in the market. There was some amount of work in the design aspect too. It was a big project with around 30-40 people involved. I had project leads, and most of our work came through them only. They would tell us what to do and guide us along the research we had to do. The professor would come just to get an idea about what was happening.
As for the one at Wipro, the company that I was interning at works on the efficiency of production lines. In India, we have very archaic lines, so we have multiple alarms on production lines. Each has different components, and if one gets triggered, multiple other ones get triggered, too. So if the product stops moving, all subsequent alarms will go off, too. This entire process happens in minimal time gaps. My work was based on clustering to get an idea of which alarms will go off together. What is triggering the entire thing? If you have the answer to these questions, and if you have ten alarms going off at once, you know exactly what to work on to rectify the situation.
With regards to my research internship, my experience was along the expected lines. Given that mine was a strategy internship, I had an idea of what it would entail: reading reports, doing some research on the internet, and finding research papers from professors who were working on it.
The internship at Wipro was slightly different from what I had expected. What I expected, or at least the image I had of corporate tech, was that you do a very set amount of work. Maybe it was specifically the case of the company I worked in, but I observed that my boss gave me a lot of freedom. He never expected me to get everything done or always be correct. It was fun in the sense that I got to explore a lot. That‚Äôs probably one of the best things a student can ask for because, at this point, we are not sure about what we want to do.
Key Advice:
People should try to explore things that seem interesting to them rather than following hearsay. If you have some information about a domain or a company, it‚Äôs a good idea to go into the depths of it. If something seems interesting to you, pick it up, study it and see if it is something that fascinates you. If it does, pick up an internship in that domain, else continue whatever it is that you do. Keep exploring and eliminating options.
Suppose you're considering working with a startup. Figure out where the startup is in the industry. Go to their website and see the backgrounds of people who work there. See what's happening with them on the news. Just try and be a little careful when you pick up startups.
As far as professionalism goes, one thing that I learned was that communication is critical. Be it the documentation of your work (so that other people can understand what you are doing) or just consistently being in touch and giving them an overview of what you're doing- it is very important to prioritise communication.

Yash Solanki - Google Summer of Code
BSP
Nov 8, 2023
2 min read
Yash Solanki (EP)
Interned at GSoC (Google Summer of Code)
Domain: Improving the ‚ÄòRoot‚Äô Software for High Energy Physics
Introduction
I am a current 3rd year EP student from Delhi. I interned in GSoC (Google Summer of Code) - a program by Google that allows students to contribute to open-source projects to help improve software developed by companies. I worked under CERN through GSoC, contributing to 'Root', a software that simulates High Energy Physics.
Motivation
While using Root to perform simulations myself for a project under a professor, I realised some flaws with the software, which I communicated to the Professor. I went on to contribute to the ROOT and one of the maintainers recommended me to raise and solve these issues as part of GSoC since CERN happened to be one of the companies registered in GSoC. Furthermore, I have extensive development experience in C++, having taken several high-level courses in advanced C++. It helped me understand the codebase with relative ease.
Application Process
I didn't apply for anything else. I only applied for GSoC since I knew the project I had requested to contribute to was a high-priority project for CERN. I wasn't sure whether I would get through, but I was excited by the opportunity to contribute to software that my department uses in academia. One of the coolest parts of the internship was when CERN invited me to give a small lecture on all the updates and new usage flows of Root to students from different institutions (including IITD) who had gone to CERN for their internships!
Intern Experience
The internship experience was very fruitful. It was a 3-month long internship from May to September. The workload wasn't hefty and was manageable enough for an online internship. The deadlines weren't rigid and were mainly based on how much work I could manage in the given timeframe. Even the people conducting the internship were pretty helpful. Whatever issues I had (which mainly consisted of understanding and interpreting the codebase) were resolved swiftly through online communication channels with the mentor assigned to me on the project or through weekly progress/updates/doubt sessions that the company would conduct. Also, the technical proficiency I enjoyed with C++ helped me quickly adjust and adapt to the new codebase.
Advice to Juniors/Prereqs
There are no specific prerequisites for an internship like GSoC. It depends on the project you decide to take. If you would like to do GSoC, you should simply have some intermediate skills in a field of your choice. For example, if you would like to pick up an ML or analytics project, you only need decent technical proficiency in ML or data science. Simply choose one particular skill that interests you and excel at it. Then, choose a project at the intersection of your skill and interest, and you're all set to apply to GSoC!
Would you recommend GSoC to juniors?
Yes! I would recommend it. It's one of the best online internships you can come across. It's cost-effective as you don't need to pay for travel or anything. It helps develop your technical proficiency while still posing a decent challenge. The experience and stipend are very decent, and the workload is manageable. The application process is fairly competitive, but it's pretty manageable if you have technical proficiency and a straightforward project in mind.

Ankit Kanwar -
BSP
Nov 8, 2023

Ankit Kanwar (AM1)
Interned at a startup called Swachh
Domain: Rapid Prototyping and Automation
Interests and Motivation
I am very tech-savvy and like to use a hands-on approach to figure out how things work, be it software or hardware. I also like building stuff. During my JEE days, I was into coding, which built an inclination towards software engineering. When I got into the second year, the courses aligned with my interests quite well, and I enjoyed the classes, so my interest got moulded toward my core areas, too. I had a 50-50 split between core and software engineering, and in the quest for an intern that satisfied both domains, I landed upon this intern in a startup called Swacch.
Process of Application and Preparation
The application process was through the OCS portal, which started around August 2022, but I did not apply for the first half of the process because, at that time, I felt my CG wasn't good enough, and I wanted to improve it before applying. My CG was at 8 in winter, so I decided to get into the OCS winter processes, and their application came through. Later, I got shortlisted and interviewed. There weren't any predetermined CG criteria(even though the shortlisting may have CG's influence in the background), and people from branches like CS, ME, EE, ECM, and MS were shortlisted, so it was open in that sense. The shortlisting was followed by interviews- the first round with the founder, who shared the startup's vision, and a round with the co-founder. The final round involved an assignment based on the domain of our applications that needed to be completed within two weeks. We were later selected and assigned fields based on our interests and projects.
I didn't prepare for the Internship. However, I was already doing courses like DSA as part of my coursework and had some prior knowledge in some domains. Some part of learning was also on the go in the Internship itself.
The Internship-Introduction, Introspection, and Inferences
The intern acted as my portal into the world of startups. It was based in Hauz Khas Village near SDA. My primary workflow involved Rapid prototyping- Understanding the requirements of the founder in terms of the design philosophy of the machinery involved in harvesting Carbon dioxide, designing components in CAD (Autodesk Fusion), 3D printing some parts, testing, and reiterating them. I was also involved in automating related machinery using tools like Raspberry Pi and Arduino and coding in Python.
The work culture was different compared to what you may expect from general corporate culture as sometimes the hours were longer than expected, and a whole day could go by if the day started a bit late, leading to a feeling of lack of time to recharge.
As part of my learning experiences, I learned to optimise stuff and familiarised myself with product designing, which worked well with my interests. I delved deeper into the world of microcontrollers, which touched upon my hobbies. The Internship served as a crash course in time management, especially regarding long working hours, accommodating other aspects of life with work-life balance, not giving in to tasks, and relaxing too much. Tracking of stuff, especially deadlines and objectives, also played a central role, especially in a dynamic startup environment. I also learned the importance of self-reliance when making decisions on the go, as there won't be people ready or available to help you in trying times.
The tangible benefits involved getting a LOR, which helped secure my third-year Internship. It also allowed me to tap into the vast network of people through the founder, leading to diverse corporate relations. It also involved a stipend and completion certificate.
As part of cool goodies, I got to design and 3D print a small cake for one of my friend‚Äôs birthdays. I also got an Iron Man arc reactor 3D printed for myself. The Internship did lead to some amount of restriction on other things I wanted to explore in the summer, especially considering the 3rd year intern process started just after this ended. I want to explore more software-oriented opportunities in the future, as this Internship was more core-focused.
Key Advices
Be vigilant about where you are applying and use your sources in the related industry to familiarise yourself with the nature of work and workload before applying. This will help you make better career decisions, prevent burnout, and keep your expectations and preparation in check. When going into startups, explore the startup field beforehand to ensure that they overlap with your passions, interests, or future goals. Your research about domains should be satisfactorily good.
Keep a journal of your work: record conversations, especially your peers' and seniors' inputs and suggestions.
Improve your decision-making algorithms, especially in independent thinking, which should be later justifiable.
Workflow may be different sometimes, and you may need to keep switching back and forth. So, flexibility in terms of workflow is essential without sacrificing productivity.
It isn't always possible to be happy or content even if you are working in the domain of your interest, as several other factors come into play, like the company's vision, devotedness, work culture, etc.
Keep clear communication with your seniors and ensure that you both are on similar terms while setting out on specific paths. This will help you maintain a sense of harmony and teamwork in the long run.

Pravar Kataria - Jane Street
BSP
Nov 8, 2023
7 min read
Pravar Kataria (CS1)
Interned at Jane Street
Domain: Quantitative Trading
Hello, and welcome to the 2nd Year Intern series by the Board for Student Publications at IIT Delhi. Today, we are pleased to interview Pravar Kataria, who interned at Jane Street after his second year. Pravar, please start by giving us a brief introduction of yourself and your intern experience.
I'm Pravar, a third-year student majoring in Computer Science at IIT Delhi. During my second year, I interned at Jane Street (as a quantitative trader), and this year, I'll be interning at Optiver in the same profile. This role is focused on trading and less on the software side of things, so it was similar to that of a researcher. While traders also perform research tasks, researchers primarily focus on research. There's a blurred line between the two roles, and I'd say my role was more like a hybrid of both.
How did you learn about the internship opportunity at Jane Street and the application process
?
I learned about the opportunity through OCS, where Jane Street was one of the companies that came for second-year internships. Additionally, some of my friends had mentioned Jane Street and its reputation. I also checked YouTube, Quora, Glassdoor, and similar sites to understand the quant interview process. I was fascinated by the idea that it involved solving puzzles, which I enjoyed, so I started preparing for it informally.
Could you share your experiences on the interview day? Was it online or in person?
The interview process was online. However, there's an interesting backstory to it. There were two batches of students before the final interview. The first batch had to go through a written examination screening, and the second batch could directly appear for the interview. I wasn't directly selected for the interview; I had to take the test first. I initially thought my chances were slim, given the rigorous process. But to my surprise, I got selected for the interview. There were three interviews before the final one, and there was also an examination. On the day of the final interview, I was in Chandigarh for a competition, and I wasn't aware that the interview was scheduled for that day. Only in the morning did I receive a call from OCS, telling me I had missed the interview. I was both infuriated and surprised. I immediately contacted OCS and Jane Street to explain the situation. Eventually, they decided to take my interview online, and I got selected.
After overcoming that hurdle and being selected, did you experience any nervousness or doubts about the internship or the process? Were you ever unprepared, considering you got into Jane Street after your second year?
Surprisingly, I wasn't very nervous initially. I felt confident because I was genuinely interested in the field. However, once I joined Jane Street, especially in the first week, I realised there was much to learn. Many of my colleagues were more experienced, and I initially felt like I was lagging. However, I managed to catch up and I learned that age wasn't a significant factor. Most of what I needed to know was learnable, and I gradually bridged the gap.
Looking at the entire interview process and your journey, what was your most significant takeaway or learning experience?
One of the most clich√©d but essential takeaways is perseverance. Keep pushing through challenges, no matter what. The second, more practical for me, was to remain calm no matter the situation. Many times, things may not go your way, but panicking will only make it worse. Staying composed is often the better option.
During your academic journey at IIT Delhi, did you take any specific courses or develop skills in the third and fourth semesters that you found helpful during your internship?
I didn't take any courses directly related to finance or the ‚Äúsubject material‚Äù of Jane Street. However, I did take two courses that I believe indirectly contributed to my passion and knowledge. One was microeconomics, which provided a math-y introduction to economics and acted as a bridge to the finance field. The other was data structures and discrete mathematics, which involved puzzle-solving and critical thinking‚Äîvaluable skills.
There's a common belief that competitive coding is crucial for landing quantitative trading internships. How important do you think competitive coding is for the interview process and the internship?
Competitive coding doesn't directly correlate with quantitative trading but indirectly contributes. Competitive coding improves your problem-solving skills, which are valuable in trading. While some Indian high-frequency trading firms consider competitive coding ratings, it's not a strict requirement. It's more about being skilled in solving puzzles and critical thinking, which competitive coding can enhance.
You were also involved in the Economics Club. Did your involvement with the club help you in any way during your internship, or did it provide you with beneficial insights related to finance and economics?
While I can't point to any instances wherein my involvement was of any ‚Äúdirect‚Äù help, being a part of the Economics Club did introduce me to finance and made it less intimidating. It gave me the chance to interact with peers who were interested in economics and finance. Additionally, some seniors in the club had interned at quant firms, and their experiences provided peer support and insights. Overall, being involved with the club indirectly contributed to my interest in economics and finance.
Many students believe they need to learn OCaml to get into Jane Street. Can you clarify the importance of OCaml and whether knowing it before applying is necessary? On a related note, what are some other preconceived notions you had that were debunked?
It's not necessary to learn OCaml before applying. I didn't know about OCaml before my application and interview. Jane Street doesn't expect second-year interns to know OCaml; you'll learn on the job. They hire you primarily for your problem-solving and mathematical skills. Having a good background in functional programming can help you pick it up faster, but it's not a prerequisite.
I had heard previously that knowledge of financial markets was necessary, but it isn't; you only need some basics, and you'll gradually transition. I expected the process to be stressful but fun, which turned out to be true.
Could you please explain the social, emotional and cultural challenges you faced in Hong Kong?
Certainly. The challenges I encountered were threefold:
There was a cultural shock. It's not that I didn't like their food; it was just challenging to adapt to a different cuisine. Language wasn't a big issue as most people there spoke English.
None of my friends were with me initially, and it made me feel somewhat alone without emotional support.
Staying alone and managing daily chores like cooking and cleaning added to the challenge.
In the internship, the initial weeks were tough as I had no prior knowledge of the financial world and the required Python Libraries, and I had to catch up quickly.
Quantitative internships are often considered very work-intensive. How would you describe the workload and the pressure during your internship, and how was the work culture at Jane Street?
Jane Street had a relatively flat organisational structure. While there were certain preferences for task allocation, there wasn't a clear hierarchy. This flat structure helped newcomers feel included. The people, including full-time employees, were friendly and supportive. Initially, they did seem intimidating due to their extensive knowledge, but later they eventually proved very approachable.
The internship was indeed challenging, especially in the beginning. While there weren't any extremely urgent deadlines, the workload was heavy due to the steep learning curve. It was my first internship, and I had to grasp many new concepts quickly. However, it wasn't overly competitive in the sense of competing with other interns' working hours.
The recommended working hours were from 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM, but I'm not a morning person, so I'd start around 9 AM. The day typically included project work, some time for games, and meetings with mentors. Lunch breaks were provided, but the workday was quite intensive.
Can you guide us through the breakdown of your eight-week internship, including any training, projects and programs?
The first week primarily involved training in financial markets and a Python workshop covering essential data analysis libraries like Pandas. From the second week onwards, there were two projects and some games related to trading. The last two weeks focused on mock trading, where we had to design trading algorithms or create computer programs for trading. The projects were centred around financial markets, typically involving data analysis and finding correlations. I had two project mentors who were specific to the projects and didn't monitor other aspects of my performance. Additionally, there was a general supervisor who oversaw the entire internship.
What advice would you give to students who aspire to intern at Jane Street or similar firms in the quant finance domain?
First, understand what quantitative finance involves. Try to develop a genuine interest in it because it's a demanding field. If you're interested, start reading about it. You can start with books like "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John C. Hull. For Indian HFTs and quant firms, I'd recommend preparing with resources like "Heard on the Street", "Xinfeng Zhou", and "Brainstellar". These books provide valuable insights and help you tackle problem-solving. Specific preparation may be required for international firms like Jane Street as they ask for more elaborate puzzles. However, these interviews are enjoyable and worth the effort.
Second, practise problem-solving and develop strong mathematical skills. This is crucial because you'll be solving complex problems daily.
Third, stay persistent and keep applying. Even if you face rejections initially, don't lose hope. I met multiple rejections, but I finally made it.
Lastly, stay composed during interviews. The interview process at quant firms can be tough and intimidating. However, remember that it's a two-way process; you're also assessing whether the firm is a good fit for you.
In hindsight, what advice would you give someone preparing for a quant internship?
Try to gain some broad financial knowledge and understand buzzwords. You could also learn some marketing terminologies. You can also learn about Python Pandas. I don't know if this is general advice or specific to Jane Street, so do ask your seniors who've interned there.
When you get there, don't be shy and ask many questions. Make some friends who can guide you. Don't hesitate to chat with your mentor; they understand it is new for you and won't hesitate to help you.

Maathangi Anirudh - KOSH
BSP
Nov 8, 2023
4 min read
Maathangi Anirudh (ME1)
Interned at KOSH (a YC startup)
Domain: Data Science and Analysis
Motivation:
Initially, I decided not to pursue an internship in my second year. I thought I would rather spend the summer developing my skills. I was considering building my coding skills, while simultaneously preparing for the 3rd year internship season. Still, I had ample free time, and I grew bored a couple of weeks into the summer. So, I thought I could manage an internship along with skill development. I started scouting for interesting opportunities two weeks after the summer started. As it was pretty late, and I couldn't get a research internship at some foreign university, I had minimal options. I could have pursued a research internship in an Indian institute like IIMs, ISB, other IITs, etc. or I could have worked at a startup, which is what I ended up doing.
I've always been interested in finance. Even in 10th grade, I had difficulty in choosing between science and commerce. So, there was a part of me that always wanted to explore this field. I thought I could look for a fintech startup and work there. It would be my 3rd internship. I had done two more internships online earlier. One was with a venture capitalist firm, where I was an associate. I mainly engaged in deal sourcing, talking to founders, preparing market research reports, and analysing them. My second internship was a strategy role for an oncology company. My main motive is to explore as many avenues as possible because once I start working, I might not be able to explore as much. So that's why I opted for data science, since it was a field I hadn't explored before.
Application:
I started searching for companies two weeks after the summer vacation started. I mainly applied by reaching out to people on LinkedIn. I was looking for a start-up that was backed by YC, one of the largest startup schools, since it would assure me that I would be working for a promising startup with a good peer group. I also preferred that the founders be from IIT, since that boosts credibility. It gave me a sense of safety and security that at least the founder is my senior. I applied these tags on LinkedIn and found a start-up in the financial sector. They had a few data science roles open. I contacted the founder and initiated the interview process, in which they gave me a technical consulting role. The role that I was offered did not have any stringent prerequisites, and it gave me more exposure into data analytics and technical consulting.
Internship experience, hardships, and learning:
Kosh is a financial advisory company that provides group loans to blue-collar workers. My work primarily entailed analysing who to give loans to, and who to blacklist, since certain people tend not to return the loan on time. I used our database to identify potential loan recipients and recognize high-risk profiles susceptible to default. I had to use pivot tables and write SQL code. If I delve into the technicalities, I calculated the roll rates, which would show how many people who defaulted this month would also default next month. I identified these negative profiles and ensured we didn't give them loans. When I started, I knew very little about data science. I even had to learn how to operate Excel properly. But they assured me that I could develop these technical skills on the go. I could learn on the go. So, I learned SQL, JavaScript, Google Sheets, and Excel. The people were very supportive, and they helped me learn through YouTube videos and websites. This was my first offline internship, and I had to travel to Gurgaon up and down each day. Although this trip was exhausting, the people were supportive, and I made great connections. I had to complete a few projects, and the deadlines were flexible.
I had a lot of apprehensions. Being an introvert, there were many funny and awkward incidents. In fact, on the first day, I forgot to take my laptop, and I was sitting in the office doing nothing. Moreover, I was balancing this internship and my preparation for a 3rd-year intern season. I was learning DSA and doing case preparation, and it got hectic to manage. I would return home at 7pm, spend a couple of hours preparing, sleep at around 2am, wake up in the morning the next day, and start all over again. It was extremely tiring for me, but it was a small price for the experience and learning.
Guidance:
How you spend your 2nd year summer depends on what sector you want to work in. I was interested in finance, which I couldn't explore before, so I decided to look for fintech startups in Gurgaon and Bangalore. You can visit the YC website or look at start-ups founded by IIT alumni. These companies might give you greater learning exposure and a more significant learning curve than a random start-up. So spend some time researching the kind of start-up you want to get into. Then, prepare a list and send messages to these people. Reach out to as many people as possible; I applied to 20 - 30 startups and finally got this call.
Also, take every interview seriously, even if they seem minor. You might feel like you're applying to a small start-up and might get selected, but it's always better to give your best to take every interview seriously, prepare for it, and then go ahead.

Harsh Kumar Singh - IIM Ahmedabad
BSP
Nov 8, 2023
4 min read
Harsh Kumar Singh, ES1
Interned at IIM Ahmedabad
Domain: Research in the end of life management of a solar PVC
Motivation and the Process of Application
I did my research internship at IIM Ahmedabad, which was related to my core field, Energy Science Engineering. The topic of my research internship was energy policy; to be more concise, it was "End of Life Management of Solar PV." I had also done some projects in the college that enriched my interest in topics related to internships. So, I applied for a similar internship with some other professors in the strategy department of IIM Ahmedabad. One of the professors accepted my request, and I proceeded with my internship under him. The topic dealt with the proper disposal of solar panels that can't be used anymore. We didn't have solar panels a decade ago in India, so we are not particularly accustomed to waste management. Hence, we are in dire need of finding the right way to dispose of Solar Panels. My research was to study various findings and provide an effective solution.
My motivation for the research internship was mainly due to two reasons. First, the OCS only provides a few options for corporate internships for second-year students. Also, after taking advice from many seniors, I concluded that doing a research internship in the second year is pretty optimum, and corporate ones are taken up in the third year. This provides various options in different fields, and you also get exposure to research internships to know whether you like it or not. Secondly, my internship topic was quite exciting and a great topic to research, which I believed deserved a deeper dive.
Process of Application
The main difficulty I faced in the application process like everyone else generally encounters, is that I got few replies from the professors. So, the best you can do to prepare is to create a good CV & cover letter and mail the professors who suit you the best. Still, you can't be sure that you will get a reply. However, it was pretty easy. I got a response from the professor in the first ten emails I sent.
There was no such particular written round or interview. However, I connected with the professor through a call, and he confirmed. He asked about my projects, which I did in college. He also checked if I had the field of knowledge for what he was looking for, and in my case, the projects I did aligned with the professor's area of interest.
Work, challenges, and insecurities
I was apprehensive about the internship because it was offline in Ahmedabad, and I was the only person going there (among my friends and acquaintances). I was insecure about how people would be there and whether I'd make new friends, which is a fundamental human tendency whenever you are starting something new. But all the insecurities vanished once I entered the college, as the people there were lovely and fun to talk to. However, IIM Ahmedabad didn't provide me with any accommodation, so you have to find a PG nearby the campus. Initially, I did have some difficulty finding a PG, but once it was settled, everything sailed smoothly.
I faced a few challenges at the start- I struggled with understanding the numerous research papers that Professors provided; some were very scientific, while some were filled with "legalese" language. I took help from the seniors, who provided valuable advice and helped me fare through these mind-boggling research papers. It took a bit of time and patience, but most of the difficulties vanished once the phase was over.
My research was to study different policies of other countries and the scenario of solar panel usage in India and find out what policy would suit our country the best. For the work part, I had meetings with the professor every week or sometimes twice a week, and I had to report all the work I did and discussed in the last meeting. I also used to discuss my doubts regarding the internship with him. It wasn't very work-intensive. I could plan my schedule according to my ease. I wasn't also restricted from taking a work day off and going out somewhere. I could easily compensate for the time which I used for leisure. The professor was amiable and helpful, and I could work according to my flexibility.
Experience from the offline internship:
As the internship was centred in Ahmedabad, I was introduced to Gujarati Culture And learned some new things there. I learned a little bit of the Gujarati language and visited many famous places in Gujarat during the days off and weekends. There were people from many different IITs as well as DU. Apart from that, I also met some outstanding professors at IIM Ahmedabad. The best experiences of a research internship are the connections you make during the process. During weekends, we usually went to the old city of Ahmedabad, famous for its food. The Vikram Sarabhai Library of IIM Ahmedabad was also a fun place to hang out. You could have discussions there and also make some noise. We used to play UNO there whenever we were free.
Key Takeaway/Advice:
The advice that I would like to give the juniors is that a research internship doesn't need to be as theoretical as we may conceptualise it to be. In some research internships, you might only do coding, making ML models, etc. In others, you might analyse the data, while in some, you may spend most of the time reading research papers. You can opt for any research internship that you like, but you have to start as early as possible to have many options in your hands and choose what suits you best.
You should prepare a well-drafted cover letter and a decent and legible CV. You should get it verified by seniors who have already done research internships. Another important thing that should be kept in mind is that you have to take advice from seniors who have experience in research internships; they can also tell you about the professor to whom you can apply. In the whole process, you have to be very patient. I've seen people who got a research internship offer around six months before the internship, and some people got an offer even just a month before the internship. You'll surely get a reply if you have worked hard on your CV and showed interest in the professor's area of research.

Motivation
There is an atmosphere in IIT Delhi where everyone has to do an internship. I also went through this phase where there was a lot of peer pressure to get an internship as everyone around me was getting one. I would say getting an intern is not as crucial as getting the right intern. Even while applying for internships, I was very mindful of the companies and profiles I was applying to. Despite being from EE1, I did not enjoy coding and analytics work, and my passion was for finance. Unfortunately, in IITD, not many companies offering finance profiles came during the internship season. In phase-1, there were mainly consult profiles; since my passion was for finance, my preparation for the consult profiles was not very good, which was reflected in my interviews. I was a bit let down, but I realised there was nothing to feel sad about, and it was motivation to work on myself. And finally, in phase-2, Morgan Stanley came offering an internship in finance profile.
Preparation
Since I was passionate about finance, I spent the time building a broad knowledge base and reading up on stuff related to the finance world. The interviewers are not expecting any specialised knowledge from your end but basic working knowledge about finance. Of course, profound knowledge about any particular area is helpful. I was interested in derivatives, and my interview revolved around that because I mentioned at the beginning of the interview that I find derivatives interesting, so I directed the interview in a way. Second, it is essential to read about the theory of guesstimates. Basic knowledge about bonds and securities is also valuable for fixed income profiles. Remember that the company has come to select you and not reject you, so confidence in the interview is vital as they want to check whether or not you‚Äôre a good fit for the company.
Application process
The first step was CV shortlist, where they gave preference to CGPA. Then there was a simple aptitude test that had a finance section that could be managed easily through basic finance knowledge. Doing MSL302 proved helpful as it covers basic accounting stuff, which gives you an edge. The English section was designed to test communication skills and had components like dictation, extempore etc., to gauge one‚Äôs ability to interact with the global team. The interview had two finance and one HR round. The interviewers were from France and Hong Kong. It was more of a conversation and discussion since they know you‚Äôre from an engg. background they are not very hard on you. There were questions related to guesstimates like profits of CCD in one week, how will you value a building and some questions about derivatives.
The HR round was also not fancy, and they asked only standard questions. You‚Äôre a good fit if you can converse with them fluently.
Internship experience
My experience was amazing, and I immensely enjoyed my time throughout the summer. I had to report to the HK and Singapore offices. My manager was the COO of the Asia Singapore region. He was motivated to provide me with the whole experience of the profile, so I was rotated between sales, trading and structuring desks weekly. I worked on several small projects to assist teams mainly. I took it upon myself to do a project where I tried to develop optimal combinations of NDFs and bonds for an investor depending on their geography using Bloomberg Terminal and Excel. In the end, they were happy with my work, and I also received a PPO.
Advice for candidates
Focus on what you‚Äôre interested in. It shouldn‚Äôt be precisely about the company but the profile you‚Äôre interested in and the work you want to do. A substantial amount of work done at a small firm is better than little or no work at a big firm.

Preparation Process
Firstly, my degree helped me prepare the core concepts for the internship process during the internship. I remember the interview essentially required more soft skills in a conversation.
There were three aspects to my interview, HR, technical, and Management oriented. So for HR, it is more inherent in you. In terms of the management part, my experience in Enactus helped a lot, and it helped me validate my claims about my soft skills. Concerning the core/technical part, there is no end to it, but you need an excellent CGPA to make it into ITC because they are very stringent about getting high CGPA candidates only.
Experience
I am in one of the lucky branches (Chemical Engineering) due to the availability of a wide array of possible internships. I wanted to have a varied experience, and ITC aligned well with my theoretical knowledge gained in IIT. I wanted to have this experience to give justice to my degree honestly.
The intern was at ITC Limited, which is an FMCG company. I worked offline at their chocolate and coffee plant in Haridwar. Firstly the experience of being in an offline setting, I remember my main objective for the first week was to survive through 10 hours of factory life a day.
I used to work for 12 hours a day, out of which 8 were spent standing on the shop floor of the factory, so it was a physically taxing endeavor. My main job was to optimize costs to reduce wastages and increase the net yield while lowering the company's production costs, so I had to devise solutions for the same. There was a lot of evident application of concepts I learned in my courses. The idea in the internship was that you do not need to be technically prepared to a great extent, but you need to be willing to learn and grasp things in the process.
Takeaways
When you go for the intern process, make sure to talk to your seniors. When I went for my internship, I wasted a week because I was not approaching my seniors. Still, in that corporate setting, the senior managers are easily approachable and helpful. It would be best if you used that to your advantage. What a company expects from you is that you should learn new things. They do not expect a lot of knowledge on your end, all they desire is that you are curious and ask questions.
Secondly, in your interview, they did not expect you to solve all the questions because I remember that I was unable to solve all the questions in my technical interview. Still, they cared more about my soft skills while conversing with them.
Memorable Experiences
The first half of my internship was highly theoretical. Still, after my midterm review, there was this one day where we had to run a trial on my devised solution. On that day, I was acting as the manager of the entire factory, and the whole day‚Äôs production or losses would have solely been on me. Coincidentally a new senior-level manager was also flying in the same day, so that sense of ownership and responsibility is something I distinctly remember. This felt like the day which decided whether I got a PPO or not.

Area of Research:
Usually, people do a research internship in their second year, followed by a corporate internship in their third year, and at last, they have placements in their final year. I am pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science, which gives me an additional year to put in anything I want. I was always inclined to do research, and my second-year research internship ignited my interest more than ever; hence, I decided to again go for a research internship in my third year. Thus, I did an internship at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) in Program Verification. I had heard about it and got a little exposure to it and its related areas in a previous course. The sole reason for pursuing a research internship was my passion for research. I would choose research over a corporate internship any day as I am also keen on further studies after graduation.
Application Procedure:
There are two ways to apply for a research internship; you either mail professors from particular institutes that overlap with your areas of interest or apply through University Research Internship Programs. While applying for this internship, I couldn't mail a lot of professors due to some unavoidable circumstances; thus, I started my application procedure a little later than when I applied for my second-year internship. I started applying to various programs as well. MPI has a centralized program of its own. The application procedure is simple, you fill in your credentials, provide your SOP, CV, find some potential supervisor you wish to work with, and provide the contact of someone who is willing to provide you an LOR. From there, they send your application to professors, and they take your interview later if shortlisted. So I surfed their website to find a supervisor according to my area of interest. Not every university has programs, so if you are interested in working for a particular university under a specific professor, then mailing is preferable. While programs are centralized and systematic, there is greater competition and limited seats. Additionally, while I was mailing for my second-year internship, a professor replied to my email saying that I should apply through the centralized program next year. Interestingly, this is the same professor I eventually ended up doing my third-year internship. So, having prior contacts surely helps!
SOPs vs Cover letters:
While applying for university research programs, you must provide your SOP (Statement of Purpose). The main difference between a cover letter and an SOP is that cover letters are mostly personalized for the concerned professor, whereas SOPs are personalized for the university or the Research Institute you are applying for. Also, SOPs are usually required in programs, while you need a cover letter while mailing professors. I would advise one to refrain from putting assignments as projects in an SOP. It doesn't leave a good impression. One can do it in their CV, though. It does not matter if you don't have past research experience in your interested area; what they look for is your interest in any program. I got my second-year internship without any prior experience in that area. They should not think that your SOP is a general SOP that you are sending for every program; it's better to personalize it for the institute. The same goes for Cover Letters -- when you are mailing your cover letter to any professor, it's better to personalize it for the professor.
What made you stand out?
Doing a research internship in my second year helped me gain some real insights into the research domain, and I learned a lot. The professor happily gave me a Letter of Recommendation (LOR) and motivated me to pursue my MPI research internship. Having an LOR helps in University programs, and so does seniority!
Challenges in the Online mode:
Since I had a research internship in my second year, I had a lot of expectations, like going to Singapore and having a lot of fun. When it all got transformed into work from home, everyone was disappointed. At that time, the pace of my internship was slowly growing as everyone was still trying to get used to the virtual mode of work. By the time I started my third-year internship, we had gotten used to the online work mode. I already had completed two semesters in an online manner. Hence, concerning working from home, I had a better experience in my third-year internship because maybe we got used to working that way.
The work environment:
The internship was three months long. It got extended during my semester as well. In the group that I worked with, we would have weekly meetings. The professor would keep two sessions per week where we just hung out and had informal talks, talked about our daily lives, and had fun. It was a mechanism to cope with the pandemic and other stress. Those sessions were the best part because I bonded with the Ph.D. students and the professor. I developed a good habit of keeping a log of everything I did because if someone continues my research, they should be able to understand my work and go ahead with it. I also had ownership of my work. Most of my time was spent brainstorming concepts and ideas or reading various research papers. The workload was manageable, given I was doing it during my summer break.
Key Takeaways and Suggestions:
If you are looking for a research internship for the first time, I would suggest you explore your interest in various research areas. People also work in core areas of other departments; there is no restriction like that. So you may want to read about different areas and shortlist some research areas that you like. While mailing, try to have your cover letters personalized. There are a lot of opportunities and professors out there. So keep mailing. Don't get demotivated. One or the other professor will show interest in working with you. Don't miss program deadlines; they have a little competition, but they have some guarantees. Keep mailing and applying in programs as well. Make it a habit to send emails regularly because once you break the cycle, it gets tiresome to start again. Send mails even if you don't get a reply; it might sometimes feel overwhelming and disappointing, but keep doing it regularly. By the time you have to start applying for Third-year internships, you probably will have a clear idea about your interests, and you can apply in a more focused manner. Just don't get demotivated or give up. Anyone can get a good research opportunity if they have the willpower and determination to work for it.

Preparation process:
In my 2nd year, I had no clear idea where my interests lay. So I kept things going as my seniors would advise from time to time. I believe a research intern or SURA in the second year is a good opportunity to gather experience, learn new stuff and discover more about yourself. SURA gave me a glimpse of the research environment and learning on the go. I practised almost all the standard questions present on InterviewBit and LeetCode. That was adequate for several tests. However, I started to see some ad-hoc problems in tests as well. What I‚Äôd suggest to the readers is that you should have a decent CP background. CP focuses more on ad-hoc problem solving, expanding your thinking process. Find difficult problems, give them sufficient time (I spent 2-3 hours on some), and then explain them back to yourselves once you solve them. That helps identify if some aspect of the solution isn‚Äôt clear to you. Some of them involve several concepts, so you can learn a lot from them. I feel the Expert level on Codeforces is decent enough to crack maximum interviews.
Application Process:
When the season started, I applied to pretty much every company that offered SDE or Quant roles. A lot of things are out of your control in this process. Your dream company might not visit that year. The shortlisting process is also perplexing at times. In some tests, I answered nearly all the questions and was still not shortlisted. The questions on the Microsoft Test were similar to the standard questions that I had practised. Some of the other tests certainly had more complex questions. Luckily, I cleared the Interview and HR Rounds and secured an internship at Microsoft!
IITian badge:
Almost all the big companies come to our campus for internships and placements. That certainly helps and provides an edge over other institutes. However, once you clear the interview and get in, it doesn‚Äôt matter explicitly. IIT teaches you how to handle pressure, deadlines and urge you to push your boundaries. You‚Äôre able to learn faster and train efficiently. Software roles are predominantly problem-solving oriented, which is a skill you build upon in IITD especially.
Work at MS:
With 15 different projects to choose from, I was thrilled to work on the backend of their Cloud Service Azure. The project domains covered backend, frontend and machine learning. On the first day of my internship, I received a call from my mentor, who guided me to the page where I had to register. There were specific access issues in the 1st week, which were resolved without much discomfort. Unfortunately, online internships are shorter than their offline counterparts. Instead of 10, we just had 8 weeks to complete and present the assigned deliverables. They had already taken that into account by the respective teams at MS. Our last week involved interviews and short discussions with the company seniors.
Online v/s Offline
Living in Bangalore has a personality growth associated with it. As new interns, you‚Äôre fresh faces in the company. People around you are interested in a conversation. All that networking and learning about the company culture was missing in an online intern. I learned that there are pool and foosball tables at the campus, where teams gather in the evenings to have fun. As a substitute, there were dedicated fun virtual meetings, and the interns appreciated them.
Highlights:
The entire time was diametrically opposite to college. Despite working in a high priority team, the deadlines were less strict. The environment encouraged me to learn and absorb at a reasonable pace. Plus, the weekends were recharge days. You have no obligation or responsibility to work on weekends. That was indeed refreshing. Being a WFH intern, we had Flexi hours, enabling us to choose our intervals at our discretion. My mentor had some pretty relatable talks and experiences, and we had some fantastic late-night conversations.
Not everything was smooth sailing. I had to redo a core part of my work just two days before the final presentation. How did I find out about the shortcomings in my project? By asking for feedback from my manager. As an SDE, it‚Äôs your responsibility to ask. Managers are looking for that confidence. The team I worked with was always there to help me
when I asked
for it. So don‚Äôt be shy.
Take-Away
The dogma about cooling off. I stopped feeling guilty about taking time off. I realized procrastination is when you mix work with rest. One should alternate between periods of 100% work and 100% rest. You can improve your efficiency considerably. Work is most fun when you want to do it. Find a team that shares mutual interests and values, and you‚Äôll surely enjoy your time at any company you work for.

Preparation Process
Regarding things the company could see on my CV, my CGPA was a little above 8.5, and I had certain tech-related projects on my CV as well since I am pursuing a Minor in CS. Their shortlisting process involves resume-shortlisting as well as a technical test that includes coding and probability-based questions. I also did COL106 and MTL106, and these courses helped me a little in clearing the test as well.
Now very honestly, I did not prepare enough because the internship process got preponed due to COVID, and I feel given more time, I could have prepared better. So I did not prepare specifically for Quant roles beforehand, but what helped me was practising some of the top questions from LeetCode, and taking a look at Brainstellar for probability-based questions. Also, OCS collaborates with PrepLeaf to arrange some test series before the internship processes, and I used those to practice aptitude questions, which helped me deal better with the basic maths-based questions in the shortlisting test.
I did not have a very strong idea regarding my most preferred field of internship. Yet for some reason, I kept JP Morgan as my first preference. I think it was because firstly, I felt it would be more intellectually stimulating than other roles. Secondly, I wanted to work in an established company or brand over the summer, to better understand corporate culture and get better exposure.
Experience
JPMC is a financial services company. Overall my experience was pretty comfortable, considering it was a virtual internship. Initially, the first couple of weeks were spent on getting to know about the project I would be working on, just figuring out finance-related terminologies and other basic requirements pertaining to the project, because it was a field that was entirely new to me and I had no prior experience in the same.
Talking about the work, I found it intellectually stimulating. I learned a lot, starting from the finance aspect, and moving on to coding in Python, going through research papers, and understanding the mathematics involved. I also had to coordinate with the New York team, which gave me some global exposure. I was able to hence learn how team coordination works in big firms, especially because I had to interact with multiple people across teams over the course of two months. Towards the end, I had to make a number of presentations to explain the amount and type of work that I had completed to all these different people.
Besides, I liked various other aspects of the internship as well. We constantly had some sessions going on, wherein we had either had some sort of trainings or interactions with other interns where we would play games and have informal conversations. Besides that, the company also focused a great deal on diversity and inclusion, and I remember we had this session on sign language teaching us how to spell our name using the same. Similarly, there was a lot of emphasis on things that I had not expected, like initiatives for helping marginalized communities, people coming from relatively backward societies, as well as programs for encouraging women. All of these things made me feel like the work culture was very good.
I liked the kind of work I did, and I also thought it was a good starting point in terms of brand. I also feel that I have many exit options, be it in pure finance, tech roles, or even in management roles. It will give me that flexibility along with a good foot in the market.
Takeaways
When you go for the interview process, the advice would be to know about the company, the role, its primary lines of business, and their work culture, as these things help in the interview as talking points. While you are in the interview, it is good to talk them through your thought process, even if you don't know how exactly to approach a problem.
Besides that, start a little earlier, maybe around six months before the internship process, and that should help you be well prepared.
Memorable Experiences
We had a zoom session with the CEO of the company and his Chief of Staff, they had compiled questions from all interns, and then they answered all of them, which gave an excellent perspective from people who are established in the industry.
I also liked the HR sessions, as being a virtual internship, it allowed us to interact with other interns. They used to divide us into groups and these sessions created the sort of bonding that was required. Because of our past online interactions, I was able to meet some fellow interns after the end of the internship as well.

Sanaz Agarwal - Nomura Research Institute
Ritika Jain
Mar 11, 2022
4 min read
Company Details
Nomura Research Institute, or NRI, is a Japanese consulting firm offering Financial IT Solutions, Consulting Services, Industrial IT Solutions, IT Platform Services, Cyber Security Services, and Digital Marketing Services.
Motivation for taking up this field
I was mainly interested in consultancy and core. Consultancy was more appealing among the two since it's pretty generalistic, and you get the flavour of a wide variety of industries. Your job, expertise, and tasks vary from project to project; for example, in one project, you can learn about the medical industry, while in another, you can learn about the automobile industry. This idea interested me a lot, so I chose consultancy as it wasn't monotonous work, and I will have the opportunity to try my hand at a wide variety of skills.
CV Making
It is important to show diversity and peaks. So, you have to show that you didn‚Äôt only participate in diverse events; you excelled and did well there. So you might have participated in 10 different activities, but it won‚Äôt matter unless you have something to show for it. Being an inter-IIT swimmer, I had represented IITD there and had won medals, so that was a good peak for me. I was the hostel aquatics team captain, held some other PORs, and was good in Academics. Academics is a priority, so you should always keep your academics well.
Selection Process
There was no written test; it usually doesn't happen for consultancy firms; it is usually CV shortlisting followed by interviews. Consultancy interviews typically ask you guesstimates and case studies which involve a lot of analytical thinking and quantitative analysis and giving a conclusive hypothesis at the end. While the second part of the interview comprises an HR round, they ask you about yourself, your motivation and sometimes even CV points.
You must communicate well; you don't need to use fancy words or have a very classy accent. It's just that you should be able to speak clearly about what you are thinking. Apart from this, you don't need to show a lot of skills as you are applying for an internship, and those people know that you have no idea how the industry or corporate world works. They look at you and try to see if you can handle the task you are given or not. They will take you if you can reason and think clearly and have basic analytical and reasoning skills. They teach you all the fundamental skills required to do your job.
Work Profile
There are four pillars in Nomura; I was in the ISCG pillar, the Investment and strategy consulting group. I got the opportunity to work on four projects from very diverse fields. We primarily scraped the internet to collect data for our project topic and presented our research, which eventually helped our clients establish new businesses or expand existing ones. Clients come to us with questions like what is happening in this market, like manufacturing or automobile, and we give them our analysis based on the research. It involved ground to top research about an industry, and this type of research helps anyone look into the country's actual scenario. So, if I had to search any sector or background thoroughly, I had to look at government policies and whether the government is supporting them, where it originated, what kind of market it had in India, basically everything about that industry. I also did some forecasting and predictions for some companies.
Internship Experience
In Nomura, we had a flat hierarchy, so I could easily contact all my seniors all the way to the top, from my mentors who were right above me all the way to my pillar head. They were all very friendly and helpful, and I could contact them anytime and ask even petty questions. In fact, they encouraged me to ask all this because they were aware that I am from a technical background, and we don‚Äôt know how these things work out. I didn‚Äôt have any specific hours like 9-5, being work from home, everyone in the company had the liberty to work as per their convenience. We usually set deadlines for ourselves and had to commit to them, it didn‚Äôt matter when you did your work, and in consultancy work, it doesn‚Äôt usually matter.  Unfortunately, all my work was from home, and I didn‚Äôt get a chance to visit the offices.
In terms of working hours, I had a mix of both, there were days when I was relaxing, and I had a very basic job, which got completed in a couple of hours; and there were days when I had to stay awake late and wake up early in the morning to complete my task. The time you devote to your internship depends on the project you are working on. There can be days where you don‚Äôt sleep, and there might be days where you don‚Äôt work at all.
Takeaway for juniors
There is no blank statement or procedure that you can use to ace the consultancy interviews. People from very diverse backgrounds can crack the interviews and can land internships. Gather inputs from a diverse set of people and chart your own path.

Ritvik Ajaria - Mastercard
Ritika Jain
Mar 11, 2022
3 min read
Preparation Process:
I started the preparation in late July. I found the tests to be of moderate difficulty level. There are usually a few questions related to quant, dynamic programming and data structures. The questions related to ML and regression are basic, and any course related to regression is usually sufficient to crack them. Some questions are like Brain Stellar's, and others are mental ability type questions. I mainly revised my knowledge of ML and data structures for the interviews.
Application Process:
I applied for some consulting and data analyst profiles as well. After the data analyst interviews, I realised that the profile did not align well with my future goals, so I did not pursue it further. Later I applied for Mastercard and got the offer, so I decided to take it up. I applied for limited companies only after day two.
Interview Experience:
I had two rounds of interviews. The company evaluates your logical thinking and problem-solving skills in the first interview. In my interview, the interviewer mainly discussed my project in detail. He also asked me some open-ended questions related to the project that required a good understanding of the basics. The second interview was a short one. The interviewer asked me some basic questions related to ML and a few about finance since I mentioned that I was preparing for CFA.
What made you stand out?
I had done a project related to machine learning, which primarily made me stand out. We had an extensive 20-30 minute discussion on my project in an interview. I was able to explain the intricacies of my project with clarity and was able to give well-reasoned answers to all the interviewer‚Äôs questions about it. The interviewer was very impressed by this.
Work at Mastercard:
I was fortunate because I got to experience both business and research aspects of Machine Learning. I did application-based research on the ML model of a recommendations engine for a food chain company. We then used the insights from that project in the primary research. I also wrote a research paper based on the model I made during the internship.
I had a great experience working at Mastercard. Initially, I was not very sure of Machine Learning as a career prospect and was also exploring consulting. My core interest was problem-solving, not primarily Machine Learning. However, I enjoyed my work at Mastercard so much that I accepted the PPO and will be continuing to work there.
At Mastercard, I learned that machine learning is not just about coding. Coding is just one aspect of the work, and it also involves a lot of brainstorming and innovative thinking.
Work Culture:
I felt that Mastercard had a perfect work-life balance. The work used to happen only on the weekdays, and I did not have any workload on the weekends. The team also made efforts to include the interns in the projects and mentored me whenever I faced any problems. In the research paper I published, I was credited as the first author which I have heard is rare in most companies since usually the manager is credited as the first author.
Essential Skills:
I did not acquire my knowledge of machine learning directly from college courses. Nonetheless, I have chosen it as my career path. So the courses at IITD did not play an essential role for me. The most important skill I learned in college is communication. Even as a beginner in ML, I was able to interact with the team confidently. I always had the confidence that sooner or later, I would be able to finish my tasks if I put my mind to them.
Online vs Offline:
Overall, my work did not require much on-site work. So I did not face any major problems in remote work. I initially faced some configuration related issues that were avoidable had the work been offline, but they were eventually resolved. I was also able to network with the team well on video conferences; however, the absence of in-person interaction was certainly felt during the general meetings among the team.
Memorable incidents or highlights:
Going into the internship, I thought that I was good at making presentations. Despite that, I realised that the longest meetings I had were not related to my work on the ML models but rather the ppts that we had to make. This came as a surprise, and I learnt that presentations in the corporate world are very different from what we usually see in college.

Hetvi Jethwani - Mitacs
Ritika Jain
Mar 11, 2022
5 min read
Topic and Field:
I signed up for a project called 'Summarizing Machine Learning Model Predictions,' and it sounds like it's machine learning, but that's not it. It was a problem in Theoretical Computer Science, specifically Algorithm Design for Database Summarization. It involved more math than I had expected, which was really fun.
Why Research
I was quite unsure about research when I joined college; all I knew was that I liked math, and it was what I wanted to do. I think I had the research
kick
from before college, especially when, as a kid, you find all things that scientists do mysterious and fascinating, especially in movies (Dhoom 2 was my STEM awakening). But after I joined IIT, I was pretty clueless; I was doing various things and projects, which turned out to be immensely helpful and fun. I also realized that I do not like competitive coding at all and was repulsed by the coding tests one has to give during the training and placement processes for industry jobs. It seemed mechanical to me; some people, of course, might enjoy it and approach the problem like it's a puzzle, but that wasn't the case for me. Something that really pushed me towards research happened in my second year. As a part of the Physics and Astronomy Club, I worked with 2 or 3 alumni on a literature review of 10-15 papers in Computational Neuroscience. I spent a lot of time reading and
learning
to read research papers, and I loved that. The range of the papers was huge, and even though I didn't understand a lot of it, I liked and enjoyed it. Wanting to try research, I took up a project under a professor and started applying subsequently.
Finding out about the internship
I knew about Mitacs through one of my seniors who had gone for this internship in her second year (Earlier, it was open to second-year students). I was really worried about not getting a corporate internship because at IIT in general, even if there's nothing to worry about, you still get conscious of your decisions when they deviate from the norm; everyone around you would have an internship or would be enjoying at least a little bit of success. It's like that with research, but my professor reassured me and told me not to worry as there are good research opportunities in the industry as well. The really good thing about Mitacs is that they pay you, which is not assured, especially in cases of cold mailing.
Application and Selection Process
I think eligibility, more or less, is students having 'one to three semesters remaining in their program as of Fall 2022'. The exact eligibility is on their website, and they're very responsive over mail as well regarding any queries.
You first fill out a standard application form; there are sections about your personal achievements etc., but the other important part of the application is choosing your projects. The projects are from all departments, from mathematics to humanities. Some projects explicitly state that they need a person with a specific skill set, e.g., someone who knows Java. You can fill out a preference for a maximum of 7 projects, and after that, it's like JoSAA but with interviews. Most professors take interviews; some don't. It's really dependent on both the professor as well as the volume of applications of the project. In my case, I had interviews for projects with priority ranks 1 and 2. I got an acceptance in the first one, so I was then out of the process for other projects. And say if I had gotten acceptance for the third one, it would, for sure, mean that professors 1 and 2 had not accepted me.
Regarding the interview part, I believe that I was able to clear it as I had explored a variety of stuff earlier (the 1 2 3 4 project, Computational Neuroscience for PAC, a side project in making an app in the middle of a hackathon, and a subsequent project under a professor) and it helped that I had applied for a theoretical project that required more mathematical background. The first question I've always been asked is what is this mathematics and computing degree and how is it different from computer science; in a theoretical sphere, it helps me stand out as, by virtue of coursework, it has made me more rigorous when it comes to approaching problems. The professor asked me 3-4 questions, and one of them was to talk about a problem that I really enjoyed solving even if I couldn't reach the solution. I think he could see my enthusiasm for the problem; it didn't matter much if my skill set was specific or not, I think I showed my enthusiasm and the capability to be driven to the professor by that question as well as accept that I wasn't able to solve a problem and did some jugaad to make it work. It showed that I was enthusiastic, could describe the problem to another person, and accepted that I couldn't properly solve it, which is quite difficult for people but simultaneously important in research.
Expectations Beforehand
While applying, we had to sign this contract which basically said that we'd come to Canada, but then within two weeks, they sent us an email that it wouldn't be possible because of COVID-19, so that was unfortunate.
What I had heard about Mitacs before was that it's not possible to make a significant contribution in such a short time, and it's mostly just coding work. But fortunately, I enjoyed the work and wanted to take it to a position where some other student could pick it up. I found the UI building part slightly challenging, and had not expected UI development in Java to be that difficult.
Overall Experience
It was really good, even if it was online. They used to have weekly meetings and didn't micromanage me at all. They weren't demanding daily updates; they gave me the space to read, and I was a bit slow at work because the problems we were thinking about weren't apparently trivial either. They were responsive over email as well, and even though it was remote, I felt that I had the time and space to actually think about things, read up and ask questions since the meetings weren't that frequent. I really liked the project, and it was kind of unique in the sense of having two supervisors. One was a professor at the Canadian university and the other a researcher at a lab in the USA. Now that I'm applying for M.S. and Ph.D., I have inputs from a researcher in academia and a researcher in the industry who are very helpful.
Takeaways
I think my biggest takeaway would be that it's good to be vocal and ask questions, even if you think it's trivial. It's important to ask questions to the people you're working with so that you don't get stuck at certain points.
The Relationship for Future
I think the biggest help for me with respect to this internship is the connections I've made with not one but two very helpful supervisors. I think the academic relationship I've built with them is quite valuable; both of them are in a database field, and even if that's not an area of my interest, just knowing and connecting with such brilliant people while knowing how they solve and approach problems is precious to me. Knowing that I can email the two of them if I ever need help in the academic sense of things, e.g., if I wanted to connect with another professor in the same university, I can email this person and ask them to connect us and so on.

Ayushi Garg - Finmechanics
Ritika Jain

The Beginning
Every fresher is told to explore as many opportunities available in the first year as they can. So I had friends from different circles. The ones in debating preferred consulting, and those in CS wanted to do something around ML. Being in ME2, I felt that it is essential to have an open mind and not get fixated on certain options. In my second year, I had a diverse set of courses from SBL to COL along with statistics and economics. I enjoyed them all, and hence I did not have any specific preference about which company or path I would like to have an internship under. I applied to all the companies that I liked. I did not have a specific reason to go for FinTech.
Preparation Process
FinMechanics does not have a CV shortlisting procedure, but I had prepared them intensively. One should not just apply with a consulting CV even though FinMechanics come with the consulting role, if you have done coding projects, preferably in Java, it would be a great plus. Our year did not have many Consulting companies except Nomura, Strategy& and hence I included the Projects section in my Consulting CV too which is unconventional. They do not have a branch bias or a CGPA cutoff while shortlisting. I did puzzles on Brainstellar and did coding problems regularly to be fairly thorough for the coding/quant rounds. The subscription to Prepleaf provided by OCS was also quite helpful along with the coding tests they conducted.
Selection Procedure
The procedure had a test containing four sections and two rounds of interviews if selected. Test performance mattered more than CV for getting an interview to shortlist. The four sections were split as follows and the test was conducted on Google Forms-
Your information and generic subjective questions such as ‚Äúyour biggest achievement‚Äù, etc.
Next was the math sections which tested concepts majorly from class 11th and 12th from Sequence and Series etc. There were also some general quant ques.
Next up was the coding section containing questions from OOPs, SQL and general syntax debugging,
The last section was related to your financial knowledge. Questions were asked about interest rates, equity, bonds, foreign exchanges, etc. Investopedia and CFI might be some good sites to go through them.
Once selected, two stages of the interviews were set up. In the first round, associate consultants asked questions about math, coding and our CV. Two problems were given, one was a puzzle regarding probability and the other was a variation of Binary Search. The important topics to prepare are basic Data Structures and Sorting.
The second round was where we were interviewed by the higher-ups of the companies, such as the directors. It had 5-6 people and can be intimidating. This round was HR-based. The questions asked were majorly subjective in nature. They even grilled us by giving us a variety of situations to see our confidence and thought process. Knowledge about the company‚Äôs field of work was helpful. Since it was my 4th interview, I was already accustomed to the process.
The Experience
:
Even though FinMechanics comes under financial consulting, most of the interns would work in the product development side. However, we did get the opportunity to attend the meetings with the clients led by senior members of the company and give our inputs for the same. We developed products related to treasury management for companies to use, and we were majorly tasked with either building a new platform or maintaining the existing one and adding more features to them. All of these required both the knowledge of finance and coding.
FinMechanics only hires from IIT Delhi Bombay and Madras, and hence our seniors were from there and they became our mentors during the training. We were given two weeks of training lectures on concepts related to finance and coding. Financial components such as financial instruments, functioning of banks and forex trading were taught to us. The coding components had discussions related to Git, data structures, Web Development etc. We were supposed to work on remote AWS servers for which we were given a few days to get accustomed to the whole system. In case we had any doubts, we could approach our mentors.
We were split into various teams; an average team size consisted of 4-5 people. Some groups were developing products, and some had already developed products that required maintenance. I was involved with a team responsible for maintaining a pre-developed product.
After the midterm presentation of our work, we were also given a choice to switch our team and work in other fields. People were overall accommodating, and the hierarchy of the company was flat. We were told not to address our higher-ups as sir/ma‚Äôam, and if we did, they would return the salutation. At the end of the internship, there was a final evaluation and then we were bid goodbye by the entire team in a virtual farewell session.
Takeaways
The performance in Company‚Äôs test is more important than the resume because the majority of the companies focus on the scores. Hence the summer vacations before the internship process begins are integral for preparation. Even if you are not sure about the field you want to pursue, try to prepare for each of them and the journey in itself is insightful. About FinMechanics, it is a company that prefers students with diverse skill sets, and financial knowledge is an added positive. Hence I believe everyone who is interested has a fair chance to bag the offer. It is also a good option for those looking for PPOs as 5 out of the 7 interns selected for the company were offered one.

Application Process:
At the end of my second year, I had decided that I wished to give the tech field (corporate) a try. Other than that, I had applied for companies such as UBER and a few consulting companies such as Goldmann Sachs but didn't get shortlisted in any of them on Day 1.
I bagged the internship on Day 2 through OCS after many tests and group discussions. I focused primarily on the technical aspect of things, such as coding, quantitative analysis, etc. I had very little knowledge about business analytics in the corporate world, and I was not sure about the extent of my knowledge, but that didn't matter in the selection process.
Your CV is the first look the companies have. For interns, you need to try and ensure that your CV is as impactful as possible. Also, different profiles prefer different aspects of CV. Consultancy firms prefer ECAs and PORs, and tech firms prefer projects. For this very reason, OCS allows you to make six different CVs. As far as CGPA is concerned, if you are 8+, then you don't have much to worry about. Most companies set the bar at 7.5+ or 8+ to shortlist candidates. Some companies, such as UBER, don't shortlist candidates having CGPA below 8.5. During some interviews, you may be verbally asked, "Your CGPA is a bit low. Why is that the case?" But that's where it ends. Even if you're below 7.5, your window of opportunities closes slightly, but you do get chances.
The entire schedule got haywire due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns. Everything was clumped into one month, which I believe is a pretty short amount of time. We had just one week to prepare our CVs, two weeks for the tests, and the whole thing was over within a month. It was cumbersome, we had tests every day, around 3 or 4 of them, and this was in addition to the college work, which was already pretty rigorous on its own. However, I do realize that this isn't usually the case. So I don't think I will be able to give a fair opinion on what I want to change in the whole selection process, simply because our batch was uniquely subjected to such extraordinary circumstances.
In general, departments such as CS, MnC, and EE have a broader range of opportunities than the others, as far as internships are concerned, and it's rightfully so. Anyone in the top 20% in those departments is almost guaranteed an internship by Day 2. However, students in departments such as Textile have a limited number of areas to apply. Some companies may have biases towards specific departments, but I know Ab InBev didn't. They took six people at AB InBev, and three were from Textile. It didn't matter that they were a tech company. All they wanted were smart and interested people.
Internship Experience:
I interned at AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, which controls hundreds of beer brands, including the major ones, such as Corona and Budweiser.
The profile that I interned in was Data (Business) Analysis, and my position at that company was the Principle Analyst intern. I was given several problem statements and asked to solve them. I dealt with a lot of data involving different countries and our reach, and I needed to figure out the optimal values of certain investments in various parts of the world. It fell under the tech field, and I interned for two months.
My overall experience was terrific. Before this, I had very little knowledge about business analytics in the corporate world, and I wasn't sure about the extent of my knowledge. My buddies were very nice and helpful, and they gave me time to learn things. Because of them, I realized that work wasn't a race. All my technical knowledge about problem-solving came from that internship. My learning curve was steep, but it was good.
Before this internship, I was unsure whether to join tech as a career option, but that's no longer the case. The corporate world is very different from college, but it is a highly encouraging environment with the right people. We had lots of fun assignments, team-building exercises, and fun quizzes. There was a lot of bonding within the team. We could text our teammates whenever we felt like, and often played games together.
During my intern period, the most memorable incident was the PPO announcement, which happened a couple of weeks after the final presentation. We got an email from Siddharth, a guy from HR. This came as a surprise to me because Siddharth has this reputation of telling people, "I'll get back to you," but he never does. He mailed half of us, informing us about an urgent meeting with some super officials. It was very sudden. We got the email at noon, and we had to give the presentation at 6 in the evening. We were grilled with difficult questions. We were even asked to explain the entire presentation in just one slide. Later, we realized that it was a prank. Following the presentation, we were sent to breakout rooms where, suddenly, the Avengers theme started playing, and the names of those who had been offered PPOs got displayed one by one. Everyone had switched on their videos by then, and Siddharth was wearing funny goggles. It was hilarious.
I badly wished that the internship was offline. It would have been much more fun. There is a ritual of buddies throwing parties for interns. Besides, a lot of offline exercises get planned, such as quizzes and trips. There would have been a lot of interaction offline, and we couldn't meet some of our seniors because of the online mode.
Takeaways and advice for juniors:
In internships, usually, what matters is your technical knowledge and communications skills. But, in AB InBev, what alSo mattered was whether you could think on your feet and whether you could stand up for yourself. They hired people if they were convinced that "This guy can code, and he can speak for himself".
I had an internship in my second year, but it got canceled due to covid. The same thing happened with many people in my year. They got into random internships (through sites like Internshaala) to pass their time or possibly for exposure, but they weren't that beneficial. Having an intern after your second year certainly helps, but it's just one criterion. But at the end of the day, it's just a CV point and shouldn't be taken too seriously.
There certainly are advantages of the IIT Tag. Because of OCS, we get more opportunities than someone from IIIT, or NIT. But, I don't think it matters to your company during the internship period. Once you've bagged the internship, it doesn't matter where you've come from.
I would advise my juniors not to take too much stress about such things. I hurt my mental health in trying to bag the internship. Having got an internship, I know that it sounds hollow when I say it, but it's perfectly alright even if you don't have any internship. The whole purpose of a third-year intern is whether you want to do it or not. There persists a herd mentality about such things, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter.

Preparation Process
I was pretty late at starting my preparation. I started two months before the internship process on the advice of my seniors. I practiced competitive coding, mental ability, and quant questions, primarily relying on Leetcode.
Application Process
I applied only for my core domain through OCS, so CS only. I would have considered applying out of OCS if I hadn't gotten an internship through it. I applied to many companies, mainly in the core and quant fields. For Adobe, the application process was pretty simple. I only had to apply through OCS, and they took my interview. I was applying for the post of Research Intern, so I had a technical interview where they tested my basic math skills. The next stage consisted of a test. It was a coding test with two questions, plus a bunch of mathematics and mental ability questions. I solved one of the coding questions and some of the other problems.
What made you stand out during the process?
I think my CGPA helped me get selected for the initial interview. During the interview, my research projects were a huge help. They liked that I had some research experience from my second year. I had done a project with Professor Amitabha Tripathi during the summer in pure math. We were not able to achieve anything significant in it, but they liked that I had the background and genuine interest. I also answered some of the questions they asked and got through the selection rounds.
Work Experience
The internship was remote. They sent a laptop home to us, which we had to work on for the summer. I was assigned to a group of three students to work on the project, and we had three mentors. We used to have a two-hour meeting with them every day. During the first two weeks, we invested time in deciding our final problem statement and had to present it during a common meeting of all the research groups. In the presentation, all teams had to explain and justify their goals for the project, which they call "problem defense." Our research topic was about Cloud costs incurred by SaaS providers like Adobe, modeling it correctly and attributing this cost to our clients. We worked on its solution for the rest of the internship and finally presented it at the end of our tenure. We also filed for a patent recently. We had great mentors at Adobe, who taught us the soft skills of research and the correct way of presenting our work. I found this especially helpful. Overall, the research experience was amazing.
Online Vs. Offline
I think the online experience is great with Adobe. The only problem is it is 12 weeks long, so you start the first and end the last. Also, you have no idea about the PPO till the end, which puts you in a tough spot.
Essential Skills For Research Internships
You should like research, otherwise, it will get boring after a while. Other than that, you should have some basic math skills and a little coding. Mostly, you need a will to read lots of research papers and have long meetings with your mentors to understand better solutions to the problems you are trying to solve.

The Decision
I had an ongoing project under a professor at IITD for the past 1.5 semesters, so I continued working on that. Project work usually begins with the Professor giving you a few research papers. My job at first was to understand them and then proceed to work on something new from there, hopefully culminating in a research paper.
Theoretical Physics requires a lot of background knowledge, and if you're aiming for a paper, it takes about 1 to 1.5 years of work. Like, it easily ends up going to about a year before you begin to feel
ki haan ab koi result aayega
.
For the summers, I had also got in touch with a Professor at Cornell. I didn't have a lot of background in the field, which I had to cover up in parallel with the project. In the end, I found myself spending way too much time just getting the background, and the communication was not as frequent, either. So, I just decided to drop it altogether and devote my energy to the long-term project.
Academia vs Corporate
To me, the choice of academia and research sort of came naturally. I had an interest beforehand, and it was reinforced after I came to college as I found the content interesting. I didn't sit for placements. I've only applied for higher studies and am waiting for the results. Sitting for placements seemed very time-consuming if I wasn't going to take it in the end, so I preferred spending that time studying on my own.
People often try going for foreign interns too. I did apply for those in my 2nd and 3rd years. But back in the 2nd year, Covid happened. I was still optimistic that things would reopen by May or June and would do a foreign internship then, so I ended up not pursuing that further. In the meantime, I picked up an internship in India itself - a remote intern at TIFR in the field of Astrophysics.
The Procedure
The most important factor is the availability of a professor. Mailing profs can be a draining process, but you just have to keep doing it until something happens.
The Experience
The project was very challenging, as I had to build a strong background in the field first. I even took courses according to the project's requirements (although I probably would have taken them anyway as my interest lay in that field). You have to spend a lot of time studying, and it has only been in the last few months that I've reached a point where I can reach results.
This was quite different from my second-year internship at TIFR. The work back then was mainly programming software to read inputs and predict specific properties. That is usually the nature of work professors can give UG students for a short time. If you decide to pursue something long-term, on the other hand, then the Professor looks at it from a different angle, as you might get real results if guided for a long time. In fact, the Professor I am currently working under straight up said he
wouldn't give farzi projects for cv, long-term karna to batao
.
Around that time, I figured out the field I wanted to work in. The seniors I talked to recommended taking a long-term persisting project under a Prof at IIT.
You can't really go in-depth in any field in a short-term project. In fact, most of the work you do in a long-term project is actually updating yourself up to the level where the world actually is in that field and where the work is being done. This requires a very long period of study. Taking up a long-term project might also help out with BTech Project, as you build a rapport with the Professor. In fact, my seniors advised me to turn the long-term project into my BTP, and some people often do this, but I decided to pick up a different one. You are also more likely to get a good LoR from the Professor.
The workload was quite low initially, the same as about one extra course. As I progressed, about equal to 2 courses. As I have been focussing almost entirely on it for the past few months, I'd say it's been taking the same amount of time as three courses. That doesn't mean that there weren't any on-off periods. I would often put things on pause when I felt stuck and then revisit it later. Motivation for a project does tend to go up and down, as there are often doubts whether it will actually lead to something.
The project I did was in the field of Condensed Matter Theory. If you have many particles entangled with each other (have a coherent quantum phase), then quantum effects can have macroscopic consequences. The most commonly known example of this is the superconductor, in which the electrons behave as bosons instead of fermions, leading to its many cool properties such as zero resistance and repulsion of magnetic fields. The work I did involve studying a broad category of new materials which have been theoretically predicted, and we have built models to study them. My work mainly involves predicting the experimental signature produced when two Weyl semimetals are brought together, and a magnetic field is passed through them.
Challenges
I did feel demotivated a lot of times, but those feelings were usually regarding the project, and that happens a lot in research, but I never questioned my broader decision of pursuing a career in research.
It is very, very difficult to get a research paper out in your four years of undergrad, at least, that is the case in theoretical physics.
That doesn't mean it isn't valuable to work on it. Even if the project doesn't lead to any tangible results, it is still something that you can write about in your application. You can also get a good letter of recommendation from your Professor, which is the most valuable part of your application if you're going for higher education. Professors usually don't give out letters of recommendation unless they are very convinced of your abilities as it also affects their academic reputation. In fact, one of my friends was expecting a Prof to write for them, but he just straight up refused. LoRs are very rigorous, as you have to give the mail of the Prof to the organization, and they reach out to Prof with the questions.
The Road Ahead
There is a continuum of quality in the Universities, and most people, including myself, pick which universities to apply to based on our profiles. If you're careful with this, those who apply usually always get something.
I have applied to a total of 8 universities on a similar basis. Applying to a few elite schools while also having some safe backup options. About 6-7 of these are Ph.D. programs, and 2-3 are Masters. This is because Europe and Canada require you to do a Masters before you can do a Ph.D. there (three years), while the same isn't true for the US, where you can apply directly for five-year Ph.D. programs after your undergrad.
This is a place where foreign interns might prove useful. If you have good relations with a Professor, then your application might be more preferred in their college.
Universities have a holistic approach towards evaluating applications, but holistic at elite school ends up meaning ki sab hi badhiya hona chahiye.
Finances are something you have to take into account while applying. For instance, I didn't apply to UK universities as they don't usually have many internal scholarships, and I didn't want to go through the hassle of reaching out to external bodies. In places like Canada and US, you get employment as Teaching and Research Assistants besides getting your tuition waived off internally, so I preferred the universities there.

Shivang Seth - Strategy&
Ritika Jain

Preparation Process:
When our internship season came around, I was interested in applying for finance roles in companies like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, thus most of my preparation was centered around them. It was only when I got shortlisted for Strategy& that I started to prepare for consulting interviews. I started with watching case interview videos by Case Interviews Cracked (Youtube Channel) and practiced solving guesstimates with my friends.
What made you stand out?
I think there were two points that made me stand out. First was my debating achievements. Consulting companies value debating experience because that is an indicator of good communication skills. The second was my KPMG internship in my second year. At KPMG, I had worked on mergers and acquisitions, and that experience was highly relevant to this job profile. The interviewer showed particular interest in that internship.
Application Process:
The application process was mostly smooth. There was only one problem I faced. One of my interviews with Strategy& was almost clashing with my Goldman Sachs interview due to some delays. I had to tell my interviewer in between the guesstimate that I had another interview lined up in 5 minutes, so we should wrap up. It felt very awkward, but the person said it was okay as he understood my problem-solving approach.
Interview Experience:
I liked the interviews, and I had three of them. In the first one, the interviewer was interested in my stock market investment approach. We discussed the relationship between the economy and the markets. In the second interview, I was given a guesstimate to solve. The third interview was with a partner. It was a fit interview where they evaluated whether I was sincerely interested in consulting. Overall I liked the process and had an enriching experience.
Work at Strategy&:
At Strategy&, I was assigned to a due diligence project. Consulting work can be notoriously hectic, with extended hours and working weekends. This is especially true for due diligence work. In my first week, I worked till after dinner and sometimes as late as 2 am. However, there was a feedback session at the end of the week where I talked about this. I liked that my concern was worked upon. After that session, I did not have to work on weekends for the most part.
There is a myth that consulting work is not intellectually stimulating and involves making only ppts. This was not my experience. I learnt a lot and enjoyed the experience. Although that is undoubtedly a key deliverable, I was not working as much on the presentations.
Essential skills:
Of course, you should have excellent analytical skills for a consulting/analytics role. Apart from that, the work requires excellent communication and networking skills. You have to talk to the team, the managers, or even the partner, so you must be confident. You have to know how to work in a team. There is also a lot of research work in consulting. They may give you a couple of annual general reports and ask you to analyze the company. So at times, I had to read hundreds of pages in a day and come up with an analysis. So you should know how to skim through information and find out what is relevant.
Online Vs Offline:
Unfortunately, due to the online mode, I missed out on many of the fun aspects of consulting. I couldn‚Äôt travel to Mumbai for work, and my plans with friends got washed away. The partner in my team treated us to dinner for our families on completion of the project, since an offline celebration was not possible. He explained how we had only endured the difficult parts of consulting and missed out on the fun. .
Highlights/Incidents:
Consulting work is dependent on the client. If the client asks for some modification, you have to be ready with it as soon as possible. Once, the senior manager had told me that there would be no work on the weekend, so I was up late with cousins and friends on Saturday night. I woke up to a call the following day, and the manager said that we had a meeting in 30 minutes. So consulting is always full of surprises.
I want to add that I liked the people at Strategy&. Everyone was professional, and I had no trouble becoming a part of the team. Apart from work, we also had fun discussions about travel, trips, and treks. I enjoyed working with the team.

Anitej Khare - WorldQuant
Ritika Jain
Mar 9, 2022
4 min read
Anitej Khare is currently a 4th year UG student of ME1 who interned at WorldQuant (WQ) as Quant. Researcher (QR) during the summer after his third year.
Motivation:
I was sure that I did not want to go into the mechanical core, and I got that realisation soon enough in my second year. I was very rigid about not sitting in any core mechanical company! I wanted to do something in tech. I wasn‚Äôt even considering doing QR. It was a matter of chance that I ended up getting an intern at a QR firm. After the internship, I realised that I wanted to do this because I had a great experience at WQ and enjoyed the projects I got to work on.
Preparation:
Probability and statistics are very crucial, along with Data Structures and Algorithms. I did MTL108 and COL106 to cover these topics, and I did well in both. MTL108 gives you an essential background and basic ideas which you must know if you‚Äôre going to sit for QR. COL106 helps develop algorithmic thinking, and more than anything, it makes you write a lot of code because of the large size of assignments, so it‚Äôs an excellent introduction to writing programs.
After phase 1, I did a lot of CP for about six months and the general quant prep. COL351: Analysis and Design of Algorithms course also helped a lot in the interview. For tech, giving Codeforces contests and solving leetcode problems is highly recommended as a standard set of questions gets repeated. For Quant. Brainstellar and going through some classic books like Xinfeng Zhou - A practical guide to quantitative finance interviews (the book is more suited for placements, though, and Brainstellar is maybe enough for internships) is also good.
Application and Selection procedure:
During the first phase of the internship process, I wasn‚Äôt very confident about tech skills, but that was the only domain I applied to. I did a fair bit of prep, but it was not enough to compensate for the branch disadvantage. Most tech firms don‚Äôt open for ME1, and the few that did open, I wasn‚Äôt well prepared for them.
My journey in getting the intern at world quant was non-standard, and it was not very direct. World quant didn‚Äôt come in the first week or two of the internship drive, they came somewhere in mid-March which was very late, and in fact, I was planning to do a research intern by then. They asked things I was interested in, and I had done the standard Quant prep that people do and brushed up the basics of probability and statistics. I‚Äôm also doing a minor degree in CS, so that did help me a lot. WQ had two rounds for the process, and there was an initial CG cutoff. After the test, 8/9 people were shortlisted for the interview, and finally, four of us got selected. I was the only QR intern, and the other three people were for tech profiles. In the interview, they mostly asked me puzzles and probability problems; three 20-minute rounds were back-to-back. In the last interview, they asked me a very open-ended optimisation problem in the final round, which did not have a definitive answer. They were more focused on analysing my capability to think outside the box and look at my approach to a problem that did not have a simple solution. The interview went well, after which they extended the internship offer to me.
A tech company usually looks for a solid skillset in DSA, operating systems, and DBMS concepts. Quant firms are looking for a good understanding of Probability and Statistics and a decent knowledge of Algorithm Design. I think that since I was doing a minor degree in computer science, I ended up picking up the skills that I needed, but Courses can only do so much, and one has to put in effort on their own to prepare for the internship process. I also had a fair bit of luck that WQ came so late, but mostly I got the internship because I was consistent with my preparation.
Internship experience:
It was a very new experience for me as I did not have any exposure to Quantitative finance, mainly as most of these opportunities are not accessible to people other than from circuital branches.
I was a part of their Mumbai office, but unfortunately, the internship happened online. I had to do two projects, the company assigned one, and I could choose from a list of projects for the other. My assigned project was associated with the data science team. This was a research project where I had to implement an idea and conduct statistical tests to check its feasibility. I wanted variation between the two projects, so I chose my second project to be a script development one. I interacted with an extensive set of people worldwide since the company has offices in New York, Vietnam etc. Through my projects, I got a good glimpse into the work of a quantitative researcher at WQ. I felt that the nature of the work was not super collaborative and was, at times, somewhat siloed. Still, I really enjoyed the work culture. Additionally, I had a lot of flexibility. I could work at my own pace, and my supervisors would check in periodically to guide me and give their inputs. I did not know anything about finance, but that wasn‚Äôt an issue as they gave me appropriate guidance wherever needed. My conversations with my advisors were always very informal, and I learned a lot from them. Overall, the internship was an excellent experience for me. It gave me a sense of direction about what I want to pursue as a career since this line of work fits well with my skills and interests.
Advice for candidates:
Use your time wisely. Summer after the second year is the ideal time to start your prep. If you wish to sit for quant roles, try doing MTL106/108 in the second year and seeing blogs like Brainstellar. Also, it‚Äôs good to get in touch with Competitive Programming and practice the commonly asked problems. While doing courses like COL106 is helpful, one can learn the material on their own, and in the end, it comes down to how much practice you put in

Why Research?
There were primarily two reasons. I decided to pursue higher studies, and research experience is crucial for applications and an integral part of the studies. Besides recommendations from the institute professors, an external LOR also helps. The second factor was about credit. In a corporate role, work done by us(employees) results in dividends for the higher-ups. I wanted due credit for my work, and research offered that.
Preparation Process
To apply for research projects, one needs to build credibility and proper background. I applied for DISA in 2nd year but didn‚Äôt get it. So, I took projects and project-based courses in the 3rd year, some team-based and some individual. They helped me understand the thought process, learn the etiquettes, and gave me insight into the art of ‚Äúdirected findings.‚Äù
One of the main things I believe helped me bag this internship was my research statement (aka Motivation letter/Statement of Purpose). It is an essential element, along with the research projects. I effectively communicated my clarity of purpose and motivation in the statement.
Application Process
I scoured the internet for professors working in my fields of interest. I wanted my research to result in a paper and hence was willing to work on long-term projects. Highlighting the same, I started to send them emails around the beginning of March. I initially mailed professors from top colleges but knew inside that I might not receive a positive reply from them. I had approached some professors for an internship in the 2nd year also. One of them liked my profile but couldn‚Äôt offer me an internship due to the constraints put by Covid. However, he mentioned that he‚Äôd connect me to more projects in the future. Staying true to his word, when I sent him an email this time, he recommended me to the project at Clemson.
Work @Clemson
The project focuses on modifying and applying DL techniques for water level analysis. I knew international travel would be iffy because of the onset of the 3rd wave in the US in mid-March, and hence the internship was remote. The Ph.D. students I worked with were friendly and fun. Being remote does affect the speed of research but not necessarily the performance. Since research is inherently slow, that didn‚Äôt cause much trouble. This was my first experience of a truly interdisciplinary project, and I enjoyed it.
Highlights
After learning the trade through my previous projects, this was the first one where I proceeded in a focused direction. The professor was impressed by the rate at which I made essential findings, which was encouraging. I‚Äôm involved in the project currently (despite the end of the initial period), and we‚Äôre close to publishing our results in a paper!
Take-Away
I learnt the procedure of writing a paper, which involves several iterations. I can also say I‚Äôm comfortable reading journals and papers from conferences and extracting relevant ideas/information from them. :)

Application Process:
I decided to go for an internship towards my second year. No one really thinks about internships before that. That is when everyone starts, and I, too, wanted to try it out and see if it worked for me. Our intern season got extended because of lockdowns. Usually, it takes place in August, but it started in September, barely a week after majors got over for our year. In fact, the CV portal opened the very next day after our majors ended. When I had decided that I had to sit for an internship through TnP, I started looking at the rules. That time, I didn't really know what I liked, so I was going through the process of elimination. I had done a project during the first year summer break, which I didn't find very interesting. So I was mainly looking at management and analytics. I had done an internship in supply-chain in my second year, so I was looking at that too.
I didn't apply for a lot of companies. I was very selective, which may not be how everyone goes through. I didn't see the point in applying for a company that I knew I wouldn't find interesting, no matter how big that company was. I didn't apply for coding roles. I am in Production Engineering, so I also applied for companies such as ITC or HUL. I didn't have a very good CGPA, so I didn't get shortlisted. I wasn't drawn towards analytics either. A lot of people do competitive coding and quant. But I just knew the basics of quant and didn't focus much on coding. I  guess I was lucky enough to get shortlisted, possibly because there is someone on the other side too. You don't know what works for you and what doesn't.
The internship season starts with the opening of the CV portal. I asked a few seniors to give me an overview of the entire process, which people usually do. Day 1 was around September 15. I had very little time to prepare, just two weeks. So, I decided to prioritize as I realized that I couldn't do everything. I decided to go for just a few things properly: supply chains roles and consulting, along with a few quants (such as AmEx because it wasn't very coding intensive). OCS portal CV is very different from what you have made before. So, I asked seniors to review my CV and look at their own CVs. Then came the companies. We had to apply for most of the companies through OCS, but some companies such as HUL, ITC, and even American Express accepted applications through forms. When you're making your CV, you make your CV in about three profiles, Consulting, Tech, Analytics, and Finance. For me, the last two were similar since I didn't have much background, but people have some separation for the two. For consulting, my options were LEK, Strat&, Nomura, and just a few from analytics. For my preparation, I had started doing guesstimates, which are the basic level questions they ask in consultancy firm interviews. There's case prep, and there are guesstimates (in interviews). So I was doing guesstimates and a bit of quant through practice tests that OCS offered. I also tried puzzles because someone told me they asked to solve puzzles in some interviews. I did not do coding at all. To be very honest, I wasn't really expecting any shortlists, but luckily, I got shortlisted for LEK, which was my only shortlist.
After the shortlist, I had 4-5 days for my interview. I was preparing intensely because I had to get the best out of just that one shortlist. In LEK, you're also assigned a buddy. A buddy is basically someone from the company who helps you prepare for the interview. In consulting, the interviews are a bit different. There is something known as the case interview, and there are guesstimates. My buddy told me that they were going to ask case prep in the interviews this year, so I started practicing the standard books for case prep. Day 1 was spread over two days. My interview was around 6 in the evening. I remember being very stressed about it. After the first round, I got a message 5 minutes later to join the second round. Someone at the associate level took the First round, and a manager in the company took the second round. I had got to know that I was through that night itself, although I had to wait for the official announcement the next day.
Consulting companies are open to all branches, and I don't think there's department bias. The CV shortlist is more or less random, and there are no tests in between. Every company has a different basis for such shortlists, and I don't think there is any sure-shot guarantee, at least with internships. Moreover, no one really has an amazing CV, barring one or two people. It is a matter of what clicks with the person looking at the CVs, but all in all, there is no department bias, at least in consultancy companies.
Internship Experience:
My experience was great. Compared to other consulting companies in India, LEK had just been starting to establish its presence in India, so it was like a small-knit family. They had just one office in Bombay, and I was looking forward to an offline internship, which eventually couldn't happen because of the second wave. The work culture was nice, and the people were really helpful. I could just ask anyone about anything, and it didn't matter if they were my seniors. They don't expect you to know everything, but they do expect you to be willing to learn. Since LEK doesn't have a very established presence in India, I had to deal with mostly foreign clients. This was another great experience because I got to work with their associates in the Singapore office. It was very interesting because you get a very different perspective about the work culture in different places and understand the differences. It was a good company with very welcoming and helpful people.
It was an online internship, and I didn't really hang out with my colleagues. The best thing that I liked about the company was that they worked on very short cases, which took about 4-5 weeks. Luckily, for my first case, I got the opportunity to work on it from the beginning of the case till the end. Since there were very few people and little time, it was very hectic. It was all work. But when the case ended, we had a full case-team event. Usually, when things are offline, you have a case-team outing for a weekend or a vacation. In our case, it was a virtual one, and we played games like Skribble.
Moreover, on the last day of the internship, the full-time associates (the entry-level position in consulting firms) kept a meeting with us to get to know us. They were asking us our stories and telling their own stories. Some of them were lucky to be there offline and told us stories about how they worked in Peru and other foreign clients. My career coach (appointed by the company) told me that he was in Vietnam 15 days before the lockdown.
Takeaways from the internship:
I learned skills like Excel and PPT, which you don't realize you need, but you do. People might laugh at this, but Excel is definitely a skill, and many people don't know a lot of things about Excel. When I started, I was really slow at doing stuff and eventually gained speed. But managers were already very quick with it. Something that took me one hour to do could be done in barely 15 minutes by the managers. It was more of looking at managers and how they did stuff and imbibing those skills. I also did a lot of data collection and primary and secondary research. I also learned a lot of communication skills.
I'm not very up-front about asking questions or doubts. Through my internship, one crucial soft skill that I learned was that it's okay if people think you're stupid, but at the end of the day, you have to learn for yourself, even if they scold you. Even if it's someone at a very senior level, you have to ask them. They won't mind telling you the answer, even if you ask for the fourth time. Just standing up and asking is what I learned. Before this, I never really worked in a very formal setup in college, so I wasn't sure how to talk to people. I wasn't sure whether I could joke around with my seniors at work. There's a time when you can, but when you have to work, you have to work and maintain the balance. Apart from that, I also learned a great deal of time management in meeting deadlines. We all experience this in college, but I just realized it more through the internship.
Moreover, when you're working with someone, there are certain things which they do differently and efficiently, so learning to imbibe that is also something I started doing. Before this, I never used to bother how people were doing things or if there was something I could pick up from people. But that changed after my internship.
Skills needed to bag an internship and advice for juniors:
There are lots of differing opinions about CV. My opinion, which I gathered from my various experiences, is that people look for a well-rounded personality because, in companies, leadership and communication skills matter more than technical skills since MS Excel and other technical skills are easier to pick up. They're not looking for people who are exceptional at coding or academics. That's where clubs, PORs, and activities come into the picture. That is how I developed my personality.
I think CGPA matters a bit in the sense that you need to cross a minimum threshold, and I think having a CGPA above 8 is a good base. It also shows that you can balance things well. One's personality is reflected in the activities they take part in and their internships. You can't really say that you have had a good research internship in the third year yet. Seniors might say that Debating, foreign internships, etc. are good, but I didn't have it anywhere in my CV. I think what matters is how you are projecting yourself. Also, shortlisting is somewhat random because you don't know what's clicking with them and what's not.
I had also prepared very well, so my actual interview felt like a mock interview. I would certainly credit my interview. The interview was something I felt was entirely under my control. My interview was something I had gotten out of, very proud of myself. It felt like I had given my best, and I was satisfied.
Any interview in your life should be like a conversation and not a viva. You need to make the person want to get to know you. Even if you haven't done a lot, how you project yourself should make them want to know more about you. And all this happens within the first five minutes of your interview. If you build a rapport with them, the whole interview goes pretty smoothly, and you also gain confidence due to that.
What lies ahead:
I wanted to explore things through my internships. Research and core were out of the question since I didn't really enjoy my courses. Consultancy felt like a field I wanted to work in. Had it been an offline intern, I would have stayed, but the cons outweighed the pros in the online setup. It wasn't a meaningful internship in the sense that all we had to do was work and meet the deadlines. We could not get to know people, and there was no mix of that "chilling" and working. It went like working for a couple of hours, meeting my deadlines, going offline for 2-3 hours, and returning. I felt it was weird. Specifically, the online experience was something that I didn't enjoy.
As far as short term post internship fun is concerned, I haven't spent a lot of money that I earned during my internship. The first thing I did was get a gift for my parents and my grandma. I am not stepping out of home lately, but I have offered to throw parties to all my friends.

Parth Singhal - Simon Foundation

Company Details
Simon foundation is a non-profit research company it researches computational sciences. It has different departments like neuroscience, quantum physics, astrophysics, mathematics and biology.
Motivation for taking up this field
I enjoy problem-solving a lot and have always been interested in computer science. I plan to go for an MS in CS  in the future, so I was looking for a research intern in that area.
Selection Process
I applied for the internship through the company's website; initially, I had to submit my CV and SOP and after the screening, there was an interview. I was asked about my projects in detail during the interview as they wanted to look at my previous research experience along with the knowledge of ML. The group is related to structural and molecular biophysics, the research we did was in computational biophysics, and I was modelling heterogeneity in proteins using cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) datasets and Machine Learning. They were looking for someone with a  strong background in ML, and here,  my second-year research internship experience helped a lot. Apart from my internship, I did a PG level course on Information Retrieval here at IITD as my minor degree requirement, and it had a long project which helped me stand out. Also, as I am in chemical engineering, and since it is associated with this area, it helped a lot.
Preparation
You need a good level of proficiency in ML with enough projects and coding experience in python. You should have done past research internships and projects. Research internships are quite different from company internships as here you don't have to do competitive coding or crack tests. For research internships, you need to have past experience in related research and good knowledge about the matter; also, you should be able to present the work. Having a publication can really help you, but it is not necessary. I got interested in ML and was learning it mainly through online courses in my second year; after that, I did courses at IIT to get more experience in my third year. The courses here at IITD  are quite engaging with tough assignments and exams, so you learn a lot. Also, you need relevant knowledge in Math; while I learnt most of the math as self-study, I suggest you take up courses early on.
Internship Experience
My work involved the implementation and development of machine learning methods so as to analyze heterogeneity in the cryo-EM datasets. The cryo-EM data provides information regarding the conformational and compositional variability in the macromolecules and this information can be utilized for 3D reconstruction of the protein structure. Electron microscopy is performed on frozen protein particles in order to generate cryo-EM particle images. As the particles are frozen during electron microscopy, we can only generate 3D structures corresponding to a single conformation. To solve this problem we use generative Machine Learning to predict intermediate protein structures along with the free energy landscape.
This was a work from home research internship, and so while I worked nearly 5 days a week, the work hours were quite flexible. The environment was excellent, and since the group is associated with a lot of researchers worldwide, I worked with quite a few celebrated scientists. My tasks often involved presenting my work, which helped me improve my communication and presentation skills. As I was the only one working in ML in my group, and the intern was online due to Covid, I could only interact with my supervisors.
Suggestions for juniors
When looking for remote research internships, make sure that you are given the required logistical support; especially when you are working with large datasets, you need supercomputer access; while I was given access at  Simons, I  didn‚Äôt get it during my 2nd-year internship and thus, faced a lot of difficulties.

Microsoft Data Science - Jay Pranajape, CS1
Ishita Hans
Dec 10, 2020
2 min read
Jay is a fourth-year student in the computer science department. He completed his internship in Microsoft and was able to obtain a Pre-Placement Offer.
Selection Procedure:-
Microsoft, being one of the largest tech companies in the world, needs no introduction. It comes on the very first day of the internship season. Jay went through two screening tests and three interviews. The first test was based upon elementary machine learning concepts and the second was based on algorithms. All the interviews were technical and the questions asked were related to machine learning, his projects and the second year internship that he did at BOSCH, Banglore. In the end, he was amongst one of the two students in the institute who qualified for this internship.
First Day Feels:
In the starting days, he was a bit nervous but most of that was his excitement, although he admitted that working from home scaled down these feelings a little bit. On the very first day, he went through an orientation and was introduced to what the company stands for and their values. He felt very elated after entering this world and was very impressed in general by the people working for the company and found them very friendly and approachable.
The Intern Experience:
Initially, he had to select his research problem (they were around 30-40,) and a mentor was assigned to his research group. His work was in machine learning and Natural Language Processing; specifically he needed to create a topic wise segmentation model on Audio instances (mostly Metting data). Although the intern was industrial this topic was research-based, and he had to work a lot and conduct many experiments. He learned a lot of things during his internship and was able to publish a research paper in an internal conference.
The challenges of working remotely:
As Jay was doing a corporate intern, almost every day he had to attend a meeting with his teammates and mentor and give daily updates of the daily work that he has done. He mentions that there is a huge difference in team-bonding while working remotely and being there in person. He mentions that working remotely is more challenging as more work is involved and  it can be very tiring and uninspiring. Every day you are spending most of your time in front of a laptop on the same spot and there is no room for a change of scene as such, therefore it gets very difficult to keep yourself motivated.
Takeaways:
The overall intern experience for Jay was very good and he learned a lot of things. Apart from technical skills, he mentions adaptability as one of the skills that he found useful in his time there as he had to use a lot of software that he never used before. He also learned the importance of presentation, as he was shaken by how much people there cared about their presentations and how much work they put in it. He stands amazed by the difference an internship can make.

Apollo 24/7 - Sumir Kumar, CE1
Ishita Hans
Oct 21, 2020
2 min read
Updated:
Oct 24, 2020
PROFILE : OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT INTERN (
Work from home
)
COMPANY :  Apollo 24/7
SELECTION PROCEDURE
The first few weeks  had passed and I was without an internship, which made me a bit dejected. However I recovered that feeling and by late September, had started mailing universities, corporates and HR managers. I talked to a lot of seniors which helped me in choosing the companies to mail, and also contacted HRs on my LinkedIn. I had an offer from Delhivery but just as lockdown started, we received an email from Apollo247 through IITD Notices. They offered internships for two roles: Product and Operations Manager. The selection process included a 2 hr case study competition  followed by a telephonic interview (Working at Enactus helped me here) After that, 6 students from IITD were finalized.
JOB DESCRIPTION
Apollo 24/7 was working on an online consultation platform connecting Apollo Doctors to patients for the past 3-4 years. Until now they were in the Testing phase and we're piloting their product in selected Apollo hospitals at Chennai. The lockdown period saw a huge rise in online consultation and so Apollo 24/7 decided to grab this opportunity to scale their product pan India. Our job was to connect with doctors and introduce them to the platform, and then improve that based on their feedback.
INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE
For the first month, I was supposed to build and train an extensive SPOC (Single Point of Contact) network to enhance coordination with admin teams of 7 hospitals across Chennai & Mumbai. After that we developed an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) to scale this to other cities, and later on developed Marketing Strategies to incentivize doctors, thereby increasing the scope of online consultation on the platform.
The initial training period of SPOCs and doctors for the platform was very hectic and I worked around 8-9 hours per day. After settling in and becoming more familiar with the system I could manage with 4-5 hours per day. But towards the last part, we used to have 1-2  hour meetings per day and then work for 4-5 hours on marketing programs.  Weekends were no different from weekdays. We answered directly to the COO and some other top level employees, who were supportive and approachable.
TAKEAWAYS
I personally had a very good experience working because it was sort of an extension of what I used to love working at Enactus, IITD. The way of working in such a well structured organization showed me the potential of collaborative work. The feeling that my work impacted people‚Äôs lives in some way during these unprecedented times was very satisfying. The client facing nature of the job was in itself a huge learning experience  as it improved my people handling skills.
WORD OF ADVICE
Seeing people around you get a really good internship on the 1st week itself  while you are empty handed, is disheartening sometimes. My advice would be to not lose faith in yourself. Identify and improve your core-competencies and apply to profiles that you like. In the end we should remember the primary motivation of getting an internship is to have a good learning experience.  Second phase, Off campus, LinkedIn - there‚Äôs an internship for everyone in the end.

QuantInsti - Shalaka Patil, BB1
Ishita Hans
Oct 18, 2020
4 min read
Shalaka Patil
BTech Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering, 2017-2021
Product Management Intern at QuantInsti, May 2020 - Jul 2020
Application Procedure and TnP Experience:
For the Biotech branch, no core companies come to IIT Delhi, at least for the first few weeks. Last year, only one core internship came, and they too required an analytical profile. But mostly everyone in Biotech prefers to apply for non-core internships through TnP, which includes Consulting which has some companies on day 1 and day 2, and a few companies for analytics like Finmech, Piramal, ABInBev. There are also software companies, but my inclination wasn't towards those.
I could only attend day 1 and day 2 of the recruitment season because I went for Forex after that. This year, they conducted everything virtually, but until last year if you were not on campus, you couldn't sit for the company. So I could not sit for the companies that came after day 2, and I did not get an internship in Phase 1. A few companies do come later as well, but only a very small number of these are open for Biotech. In this limited branch-specific experience available to me, my real experience was even less. I had talked to some seniors to understand how it all works, but the first-hand experience was of course lacking at that time.
When I returned to campus in January, companies were still coming, but I did not apply for them, since they were not that good, and I was looking for internships off-campus. And there were a few good options available as well. But then, another company, called
QuantInsti
came to IITD, sometime in Feb, for Product Management Interns. I researched the profile and consulted seniors and found out that it is a very good position in terms of learning. And personally, I found the job aligned with my interests. Also, the company was impressive. Its original product is a learning platform for Algorithmic Trading. After looking into everything, I applied for the internship. They gave an online assignment related to data analytics and product and market research, based on which they released a shortlist of candidates eligible for interviews. We then had virtual interviews. I got the internship there.
Experience during Lockdown:
A lot of people were getting their interns canceled due to the pandemic, so I was also concerned about how things were going to turn out for me. Before the pandemic, I was very excited about the whole internship experience. When I got selected, I had imagined going to Mumbai. I had googled their office, looked at photos, and searched all about the locality. But after the lockdown, I was not sure if the experience was going to be as enjoyable and interactive. I believe that internships are meant for companies to judge whether the intern can be a future employee and for candidates to answer whether they can see themselves working for that company, which was probably going to be difficult with everything being done virtually.
The first half of the first day was devoted to onboarding. We were provided with IDs and a complete setup of the company. A proper induction was carried out wherein we were told about the company. In the second half, we interacted with the people whom we were going to be working with; about themselves, about their current project, and their past work.
After the first day, we had a rigorous first week packed with lots of learning. The company was involved in finance and trading and we had little to no information/experience in the field. The company also organized many events and we interacted with a lot of people. It would have been a great experience if it had been offline nonetheless, it was highly open and interactive because the company also understood the problems brought by the pandemic and it wanted its interns to have a good learning experience. Our reporting manager encouraged us to contact different people for learning purposes, which increased interaction.
Project:
The company is currently working on a new product which will be for Algorithmic trading in India. The method is not as common in India as it is in the US, UK. Even in our college, we don't see people engaged in trading on a scale at which they're engaged in coding activities. My work mainly comprised of researching the go-to-market strategy for the product due to be released in January. That involved market research, knowledge about the product, competitors, understanding the customer journey, analysis of USP's, construction of the success matrix, etc. I worked on all these things and jelling them all together.
Takeaways:
My experience was very good. The company was mainly focused on our learning from day 1 till the end and made us realize that that's what mattered the most at the end of the day. It's a very close-knit family, not a big MNC, but an Indian company of 80 people. So, everyone knows each other, there's a lot of interaction and a lot more to learn. We knew our deliverables, but in them, we were allowed to go beyond, make mistakes and there was some freedom associated with these as well. The company guided us and corrected us at each step. The feeling of growth was very evident. At all times, they were focused on our personal as well as professional growth. The company has also offered a PPO to me which I have accepted.

Goldman Sachs - Rushang Gupta, EE3
BSP
Oct 7, 2020
3 min read
Updated:
Oct 13, 2020
Third-year internships are essential things one experiences in college life as it is the first time one is exposed to the corporate world. This internship can shape the future career a lot as it can be a crucial factor for helping the student decide his future path while adding experience points in the CV at the same time. To get an insight into what an internship in Goldman Sachs related to risk stats is like, we talk to Rushang Gupta, who interned with Goldman Sachs in the summer of 2020 and received a Pre Placement Offer (PPO) from the same.
Application Procedure:
Goldman Sachs comes on day 1 of the internship season. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals. About the procedure: The selection procedure consists of two main rounds: a test round, and then an interview. In the test round, there are mainly two sections- quant and coding. You need to get a high score in either one of the sections to get shortlisted. The interview consists of 3-4 rounds in which quant based and coding questions are asked. I used brainstellar.com for preparing for the quant-based questions and Interview Bit for preparing for the coding problems. The panel in my case was very friendly and helpful, and in most cases, they gave me hints to help me arrive at the answer to the problems wherever I got stuck. They did not expect prior knowledge of finance from us.
Reasons for choosing Goldman Sachs:
My previous internship was a research internship, so I thought a bit about exploring the field of finance as well. I was open to both finance and tech but got an offer from GS first.
First Day Experience:
Originally the internship had to start from 11th May 2020. But due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the starting got delayed to 18th May 2020. On the first day, we had a session with the manager. After that, there were sessions with fellow interns to allow us to get to know each other. The first impression was indeed very good. People over there were accommodating. They helped us understand the systems and the procedure of logging into the virtual machines.
The Internship:
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire internship was done remotely from home. Also, the internship's length was reduced to 6 weeks from the original ten weeks due to the pandemic situation. The initial period of 2 weeks was the training period. There were multiple sessions where we were told about the various divisions and their works and the company's specific tools. It was only after two weeks that the main work started. The work timings were mostly flexible. On some days, there was a lot of work, while there was relatively lesser work on some days. The work assigned to me was a benchmarking exercise, in which we were required to calculate the capital number on a hypothetical portfolio. I had no prior knowledge of lots of things, and I had to learn them on the go. But, the people there were encouraging and motivating and available anytime. The work culture was amazing, and I got to learn a lot. I learned a lot about good coding practices, how to talk to people professionally, and a lot about finance and capital risk management.
I feel I missed on a few opportunities due to the internship being done online from home. Due to the things being virtual, there were instances where things slowed down due to the communication gap. Had it been offline, we could have directly approached the concerned individual but now, at times, we had to wait for them to respond to our queries/doubts.
But all in all, the online experience was in itself pretty smooth, much better than I had expected. Things went on very smoothly without any technical glitches.
Cherishable experiences:
We got to interact with GS employees from all over the world, like from the New York office, London office, etc, as certain projects were done along with them. The work wasn't restricted with just Indians. Most of the teams were pretty informal and had friendly gaming sessions (like pictionary on skribbl.io) every Friday night. The people were very helpful and motivating and did not let us feel uncomfortable at any point in time.
Takeaways:
It was my first exposure to the corporate world and was indeed a remarkable one. It was challenging yet fun at the same time. I got to learn a lot of things that were utterly new to me and have fun at the same time, and that is why I accepted the PPO they gave me.

American Express ‚Äì Anmol Ojha, PH1
Yash Sheth
Nov 16, 2019
2 min read
Hi! I‚Äôm Anmol from the Physics Department and I interned at American Express in Gurgaon.
Selection Procedure:
AmEx recruits through the TnP cell and like most Day 1&2 companies has a multi-layer selection process. The selection procedure involved a CV-shortlisting round, which was essentially based on CGPA (>7). Next was an online test, which was based on general aptitude. There were absolutely no programming (COL 106) or probability-based (MTL 106) questions in the testing procedure.¬†Thereafter, there were 2 interviews. The first was the technical round, which was mostly resume-based, a few puzzles and some technical questions. The second was an HR round. This round consisted of general questions like ‚Äúwhy do you want to join Amex?‚Äù, some more puzzles and a small case study.
The Internship:
I had heard from someone that Amex assigns a lot of work to interns but this wasn‚Äôt something I was concerned about. I was just looking forward to what unfolds.
About the internship, when a person approaches the company for a loan or a credit card, the company does a background check on the person. They have some algorithms for the same. Amex too has a risk prediction model. It can be used to increase or decrease the standing limit on a card depending on how ‚Äòrisky‚Äô the customer is. My job was to check if the model is doing well for a particular set of customers.
Work Culture:
For interns, the work that was assigned was easily manageable. A mentor was assigned to new interns in the company. They guided us on how things were done. My mentor was very supportive and friendly and he helped me a lot with my work. The people there were easily approachable. Everyone has cubicles and there‚Äôs thus really no hierarchy. If I had some issues, I could also talk to the manager, director or even the vice president! I also realised that the work-life balance was pretty good and people weren‚Äôt complaining about any excessive workload. The company also supported people who wanted to pursue personal ideas that would be co-beneficial to the company.
AmEx provides stay in a guest house for the first week, during which interns are supposed to arrange for accommodation. The workplace itself is really cool, located in a prime office area in Gurgaon. You‚Äôll find Costa Coffee and Starbucks in the same building and a lot of AmEx employee discounts at a lot of major food chains. Work hours are relaxed, Mondays start late at 1 PM and Fridays¬†end¬†early at 5 PM.
Takeaways:
This was a completely new experience for me. I saw how things in the corporate world are so well organised and well structured. Even the smallest actions were well planned and not spontaneous. I got to learn a lot about this. I saw how much my actions affected other people. There was far more accountability than in college and there are more constraints on the work that each employee performs.
In a lighter vein, AmEx makes you feel special with all it has to offer and overall, it was a fantastic experience.

ITC Limited ‚Äì Rahul Motwani, CH1
Yash Sheth
Nov 15, 2019
2 min read
Selection Procedure:
The selection procedure of ITC is quite intensive.¬†First students were shortlisted on the basis of the resume (which is generally displayed during the PPT). There is also an application form that needs to be filled and submitted on the ITC website, which is important in the shortlisting process and the final interview. ITC usually has 8 CGPA criteria, however, this may or may not hold. Usually people with some PoR and ECA are shortlisted.
Next is a Group Discussion of about 20 minutes involving 7-8 people.¬†A topic was given, and the group had to arrive at a conclusion through discussion. In my GD, the topic was about the culpability of a certain person, given a situation. Usually, 2-3 people are shortlisted from every group.
Lastly, on Day 1 there were 2 interview rounds, both of which consisted of 2 interviews. Each can typically be between 20-40 minutes long. There is no strict demarcation of tech and HR interview. They usually talk about your past experiences, PoRs, academic activities and KITES form. The first round panellists are generally younger recruits while the second round panellists typically occupy high positions in the firm.
Internship Procedure:
The overall project was based on the development of sustainable paper packaging. Have you seen paper cups at Nescafe and Amul? They are not exactly recyclable because they use a Polyethylene layer to provide a barrier against the liquid. My project was more on the lines of Research and Development where I worked on a product on which the company is yet to launch commercially in the Indian Market, reducing the amount of plastic used in the packaging.
Fun Incidents:
My roommate got drunk once or twice and has had some interesting conversations with his managers. I also remember an intern from IIT Roorkee who was talking to a senior HR manager about his love life (He promised he won‚Äôt drink a cocktail of whisky and vodka next morning :P). The best part of the internship, however, was the orientation at ITC Windsor, Bangalore, in the month of March.
How was the work culture?
The work culture at ITC is pretty rigorous, the company administration consists mostly of IITians. However, the system is set up to support the intern a lot. For example, whenever I wanted to conduct experiments, I could stop a 90 crore machine at my will and do anything as long as could explain the theory and logic behind my ideas. People respect IITians and their thoughts and ideas are warmly welcomed by CXOs as well.
Students should expect to spend 10+ hours at the factory. I remember pulling 20+ hours shifts a couple of times to finish experiments and get trials done. You get the ownership of a project and the improvements you suggest get reflected in crores. Perks of working in the FMCG sector.
Takeaways:
The internship was highly rewarding and taxing, both. It took a lot of mental strength, but the overall experience was definitely positive. It gave me the confidence to stand out of the line and voice my opinions.

AB InBev ‚Äì Akshat Agarwal, EE3
Yash Sheth
Nov 15, 2019
3 min read
Akshat is a fourth-year student in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering. He completed his summer internship at AB Inbev and was also offered a Pre-Placement Offer.
Application Procedure:
Anheuser Busch InBev/AB Inbev comes on Day 2 of the internship season. What does it do? Basically, Beer. It is the world‚Äôs largest brewer and also one of the largest FMCG‚Äôs in the world. About the procedure: You attend a Pre-Placement Talk, which was quite impressive. There is no CV shortlisting, but selection procedures differ year to year. In my year, it was done through three tests; first was the quantitative section, consisted of twenty-five or thirty questions to be solved in thirty minutes. The second part was coding-based, consisted of three questions to be solved in thirty minutes. The last part was based on SQL and consisted of ten questions.
First Day Feels:
This was my first company experience, very different from a research internship. I was scared because there were people who were more academically qualified than me, joining the internship. I was very sceptical about whether I would be able to deliver or not and what would be required of me. So from the very first day, I was motivated that I wanted to perform well and take a PPO if they offer it.
The Internship:
AB InBev has two offices in Bangalore, the GAC (Growth Analytics Centre) and GCC (Global Capabilities Centre). I was stationed in the GCC, which deals with Financing and Operations. The profile was ‚ÄòBusiness Analyst‚Äô, and it was ML oriented.¬†The project assigned to me was in the operations division was related to financial accounting. In ABI, once an order is executed, there is a reconciliation process, involving tallying two sets of records to check if they‚Äôre in agreement. ABI sells to wholesalers and the dealings are in credit. The wholesalers are expected to pay back within a given timeline. This credit business is governed by ABI‚Äôs credit policy, which has been overlooked for a long time. So, I was basically required to create an automated tool, which would take in this credit data, and identify where the red flags were so that suitable action could be taken on it. Essentially, fraud detection.
The work culture was really really amazing. It is a Brazilian multinational company, so there were people from all countries and cultures. I especially loved the fact that ABI was concerned about what we got from this experience and made sure that we had an enjoyable time. Also, there was no bifurcation on the basis of departments or hierarchy. I got to learn and have fun and that is why I accepted the PPO they gave me.
Fun Incidents:
There were a lot of them. During the afternoons when we used to get bored, we used to book meeting rooms and sit inside and play PUBG or play loud music. One time, all of us were sitting inside playing PUBG and listening to music, and someone from HR walked right in. All of us looked up and to our pleasant surprise, found him smiling. We were all embarrassed about getting caught red-handed but then he closed the door after asking us to reduce the volume a little.
Takeaways:
It was my first company experience and it was delightful. I did not experience any of those corporate myths about how 9-5 is very repetitive and joy-sucking. The takeaway was the learning experience and the fun that I had. I could learn all that was required while having fun. So, while going for internships, one should focus on what they get out of it. The experience can change a lot about your life and upcoming choices.

Deutsche Bank ‚Äì Sarthak Vishnoi, CS1
Yash Sheth
Nov 15, 2019
3 min read
At Angkor Wat
The third-year internship is often the first time one steps into the field that he¬†will work in and is a major factor in helping a student decide his career along with imparting crucial work experience. To get an insight into what an internship in finance entails, we talk to
Sarthak Vishnoi
, who interned with Deutsche Bank at their Singapore office for his third-year internship.
Selection Procedure:
I applied to the company through TnP and the company came on Day 1. The selection procedure consisted of two rounds: CV shortlisting and then an interview. The interview mostly tests your skills in probability, math and also your communication skills, general aptitude and reasoning. To prepare for the interviews, I brushed up on coding (with Data Structures and Algorithms and ADA being pretty relevant) and also the concepts of Probability. For puzzles, there‚Äôs a book titled ‚ÄúHeard on Wall Street‚Äù and a website, brainstellar.com (though Deutsche Bank did not ask that many questions, finance companies in general focus a lot on puzzles).
I am also pursuing a minor in economics, so that helped for a finance profile. In addition, my second-year internship in Singapore was also relevant to this field.
Motivation behind joining Deutsche Bank:
I was not really keen on going on a pure technical internship. I got an offer from Samsung Korea before DB but had kept DB above it on the preference list since I was primarily interested in finance after reading a lot about it. I had asked around and got to know that it would be difficult to get into this sector if I did not try for an internship in it (advice might vary person-to-person). The stipend was one of the highest offered at IITD, though that was not what attracted me towards DB.
As a disclaimer, DB is not expected to hire interns from campuses owing to a downturn. But for any future finance-based company, the fundae would still apply.
Job Profile:
I worked with two teams during the course of my internship, the FX Options trading team and the Credit Structuring team. The job profile was related to trading, more specifically, my work was on pricing options based on volatility and market conditions. It was not coding intensive as such. I worked in VBA, the scripting language of MS Excel and an internal company software. In addition to the work I was doing, I also had to¬†study a bit of finance-related material since everyone there had a strong background in the subject, having majored in it.
The work allotted was not as difficult as I‚Äôd imagined it to be. A lot of focus was on networking and meeting new people. Since it‚Äôs a global bank, I got to interact with people from all around the world. A cool fact: I was also the youngest intern there since Singapore has a compulsory National Service requirement for all citizens.
Work Culture:
The work culture was awesome, though the hours were a bit long. I used to come in at 7:00-7:30¬† in the morning and leave anytime between 19:00-20:00. The weekends were free and I did not work at (all) home. Lunch is typically eaten at the desk, at least that‚Äôs what most people do. It was probably because a lot of time was devoted to meeting people and interacting with them about their work and life. Everyone was very friendly and easily approachable.
After a long week, Saturday was reserved for sleeping. I would travel around a bit on Sundays. I went to Cambodia too, visited Angkor Wat and the like. Some of my co-interns also went to Thailand and Malaysia.
Takeaways:
It was a great, challenging experience and most importantly reaffirmed my interest in the field of finance and trading, as a career option. 10/10 would recommend.

Wipro ‚Äì Chaitanya Sharma, ME1
Yash Sheth
Nov 15, 2019
3 min read
Chaitanya Sharma, a fourth-year undergraduate student from the Mechanical Engineering Department shares his experiences regarding his 3rd-year intern at Wipro in the FMCG sector.
Selection Procedure
Initially, they shortlisted the resumes of the Top 10 department ranks from the mechanical department and this was followed by an online test, and personal interviews (on Day 2) encompassing Technical and HR rounds. The online test was based mainly on basic reasoning and psychometric questions. My interview went quite well, it was based on basic thermodynamics and fluid mechanics questions followed by general HR questions. I think the courses at the institute prepared me well for the internship. Analytical skills, basic core concepts and ability to learn things fast were the pre-requisites.
I scored the intern in the day, and it sent me right to the seventh sky as this was something positive that had happened in a very dry spell :P. Even though I was very much aware of the boring factory-based work I would have to do for 9 straight weeks, I didn‚Äôt care about it much and enjoyed the evening, even leaving my FinMech interview slot and partying all night.
Internship & Work Culture:
It was quite hectic, to be honest.¬†I was selected as a Project Manager and my project was based on the reduction of wastage in a production line. I had to design and install parts for the same in the main production line within 9 weeks.¬†I had to do factory-based work from 9 am to 6 pm for 6 days in a week. The factory was at Tumkur, 71 km via road from the nearest city, Bangalore and understandably, all my co-factory workers were native Kannada speakers.
My factory head used to arrive before me and would go usually go after me and was also kind of disciplined in nature. Most of my problems were due to the language gap between me and the workers. Whenever I had to assign work to them something, I had to use sign language or broken English to make them understand. They were not at all proficient with Hindi, however, some of them were thankfully accustomed to very basic and primitive English. Sometimes, when my factory head was around, he would help me communicate with them, but most of the time I was on my own. Apart from all these difficulties, I still anyhow managed to maintain a good connection with most of the people in the factory which was truly a tremendous learning experience for me.
Over the weekend, I and the other interns there used to party and chill out in Bangalore and return for the project again on Monday. Once,¬†I couldn‚Äôt come on Monday due to some over-excessive partying that weekend and had to make up a few stories to compensate for the same in front of my factory head.
Motivation and Takeaways
The intern was quite hectic but I got to learn many crucial things at the end. I got familiar with corporate work culture, how businesses are run, working in a team, improving my ability to work in a non-conducive environment, meeting the hard deadlines, etc. I completed my project in 8 weeks which was supposed to be done in 9 weeks. I‚Äôd like to think that they were quite happy with my work. The people there were very supportive and in retrospect was a wholesome experience.

Daimler AG ‚Äì Arundhati Dixit, ME1
Yash Sheth
Nov 15, 2019
2 min read
Selection Procedure
I had applied off-campus. The company, like many others, posts openings for prospective students on its career website and LinkedIn. How this works is that one is expected to fill a form online, following which they have a couple of online rounds like logic and reasoning and psychometric and record a video interview. After this, I got a call from the HR and the concerned department and they took a telephonic interview. They asked about my previous experience, intended career path, and technical skills and typical HR questions.
Job Profile and Work
I was selected for VKP data analysis and calculation automation for Daimler AG at Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan. I had to formulate cost-cutting potential algorithms for a set of points on the gap between best-fit and best-practice and devise Quick Calculation Tool Automation, which essentially supports costing on a common platform in Japan, Germany, India, and the US.
I was happy for my intern and I felt that I‚Äôd not get such an ideally suited internship, so I didn‚Äôt look for more or sit for TNP interns. However, I was a bit worried about the food since I‚Äôm a vegetarian.
Work Culture
It was very different from what I‚Äôve seen with my father in India. It is a multinational company, so people of very diverse backgrounds worked there. Kawasaki has offices of Mercedes and Mitsubishi Fuso as well (subsidiaries of Daimler) and there were Germans, French, Indians and of course Japanese. I received weekly or fortnightly assignments which were a great learning experience, but the most amazing experience was working with people outside an academic setting in Japan. People were extremely punctual and efficient, and at the same time huge fun and loved to party. Unlike what I‚Äôve seen in India, the hierarchy in positions was much less marked among the employees and everyone sat and worked together. Japan is culturally very different from India, so that‚Äôs there for sure.
It‚Äôs surely a different place. At 8 am in the morning, a piece of music would play, and everyone in the office exercised for 3 minutes on their seats, which was perplexing! The funniest experience has to be the reactions I received when I told someone that I‚Äôm vegetarian. My manager said he thought for an entire week how he would ‚Äúnurture‚Äù me if I were his daughter. :p
Motivation and Takeaways
It was an absolutely amazing experience. I had very bright peers, and Japan is a dream country for me since I‚Äôve grown up watching it on cartoons. It helped that my major was mechanical engineering and I applied for inclination towards analytics because it worked in my favour in this case. Overall, the experience in a different country with a world-class company was overwhelming, to say in the least. The takeaways would be a very rigorous corporate experience and application of skills very differently from what I had in mind.

Nov 15, 2019

I did my 3rd-year TnP internship at the Mandideep plant of P&G near Bhopal in the Supply Chain Department.
Motivation:
Before joining P&G, the review that I had got from my seniors was that P&G offers students a lot of good projects and they get to work on real-life projects which are challenging and helps one grow. Apart from this, P&G is also one of the top recruiters on campus.¬†Apart from the reviews I got from my peers, my personal motivation behind joining the company was the exposure one gets after working in the Supply Chain Industry. In the Supply Chain sector, people work towards launching products in the market and look after its marketing, planning, sales, and demand. These are some of the sectors which are essential in building up skills necessary to run businesses. Lastly, P&G is a multinational consumer goods company, and the brand value associated with it helps in future endeavours as well.
One thing that I realized was the importance of Extra-Curricular Activities (ECAs) that we have here at IIT. At the end of the day, it is not only the individual work you do that matters but also the work done by the team and I think that ECAs really teach us a lot about teamwork. The technicalities of working in a team and leadership skills gained while pursuing different ECAs on campus were quite helpful for me in solving the technical problems in my internship.
Selection Procedure:
Speaking of P&G specifically, there is a Psychometric Test based on which shortlisting is carried out. HR Interview and Technical Interviews follow, on Day 1 of the internship season. There may also be additional shortlisting based on group discussions or a written test or based on resume, but these are variable and may or may not be conducted. The focus is on how an individual is able to handle team goals individually, thereby showing his leadership skills as well. CGPA is not a hard and fast criterion in the selection procedure, but it won‚Äôt be right to say that CG does not matter during the selection as we are talking about a technical internship.
The psychometric test is found challenging by many and the best way to answer it is by being honest. Rather than hacking it or finding a way around the psychometric tests, it is better to give answers as if you are in that situation and answer in a moral and ethical manner, according to your own beliefs.
The HR interview contains basic mix-match questions like, ‚ÄúWhat are your long term goals?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat are your short term goals?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years from now?‚Äù
P&G basically looks for people who will be the right fit for their company. They want to see whether the person has the potential, in the sense that he, first of all, has got the technical know-how, the leadership skills and how approachable you are in terms of people being able to talk to you and you being able to work with a lot of multifunctional teams. They want to see whether you‚Äôll be able to lead teams, whether you‚Äôll be able to act as a manager and how smoothly you will react to those with 10+ years experience working under you during the internship.
The Internship:
I knew that I might have to work in a plant or a factory and the general notion that we all have of a factory is NOT positive. I thought that I was not going to have a good working environment, but I was pleasantly surprised on my first day. The whole plant was air-conditioned, it had a lot of safety measures in case of emergencies and it was fully automated in terms of technology over there. The conference rooms were on par with the Lecture Halls we have here at LHC.
About the internship, I was given control of the production line of a particular product of P&G and the mandate was to create a saving in its packaging cost. I developed a packaging framework and changed the packing material to a cheaper alternative that was being used elsewhere. I was also given the power to make purchases for the factory, so I was also able to set up the modified packaging assembly and see it live in action in the plant. The project involved a lot of documentation, communication with an Egypt-based P&G factory and tears and in the end, it was satisfying to have tangibly contributed to a company. In the end, I was also offered a PPO, which I accepted.
It is the work culture at P&G that I liked the most, and everybody who works there would also say the same. The company offers a very conducing and encouraging environment along with a lot of generous colleagues who are there to offer any amount of help needed during the work and are ready to spend time with you whenever you need whether be it on the project you are working or be it on a personal level, just to connect. In P&G they call it ‚ÄòPVPs‚Äô(Principal, Values, and Purpose), these represent their main goals towards their people, their consumers and their customers. The PVPs is something they take very seriously and these things are ingrained with the ethos of the company itself.
Something that I will remember:
One unique thing that I experienced was that Bhopal offered a completely new atmosphere for connecting with colleagues. I remember that there were a lot of incidences when I had bid goodbye to my mentor in the evening and ended up meeting him at the same place, coincidently, during the night to have dinner!

A report on the Open House (22nd Feb)
BSP
Feb 23, 2024
6 min read
Introduction
An open house was organised by the IIT Delhi administration at the OAT on the 22nd of February from 5 PM onwards in light of the recent student suicide, the fourth case of an IIT Delhi student in the past eight months. The Open House was preponed from 28th to 22nd of February after protests by students demanding immediate attention and action to the recent tragedy. As 19th to 24th of February was scheduled for mid-term evaluations, the examinations were postponed to 26th of February and all classes were also cancelled.
The OAT was packed with faculty and students from different programmes across various departments, centres and schools. Several issues ranging from academics to mental health to interpersonal relations between students and professors in IIT Delhi were raised, and answers were sought from the administration. The concerns were answered by a panel led by Prof. Rangan Banerjee (Director), along with Prof. Ambuj Sagar (Deputy Director, Strategy & Planning), Prof. Narayan D Kurur (Dean, Academics), Prof. Aditya Mittal (Dean, Student Affairs) and Prof. Angelie Multani (Dean, Diversity and Inclusion).
The session was divided into an hour-long structured presentation of the problems and demands of the student which was curated by SAC and CAIC representatives from ~2500 responses received via an online form, after which the panel accepted questions from the students. As emotions were high, the schedule was not duly followed which led to some unrest among the students.
(From left to right) Prof. Narayan Kurur (Dean, Academics), Prof. Rangan Banerjee (Director), Prof. Ambuj Sagar (Deputy Director, Strategy & Planning),  Prof. Angelie Multani (Dean, Diversity and Inclusion), and Prof. Aditya Mittal (not in frame), (Dean, Student Affairs)  formed the panel.
Masters students
Masters student demands:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SRF5k4vzM4brSb1WdK_IlQsPIgUP98Wj/view?usp=sharing
A primary concern was the high SGPA criteria for the continuation of stipend as compared to other premier institutes in the country. Moreover, the current system does not provide summer internship opportunities to masters‚Äô students via OCS. Due to the inadequacies of the present feedback mechanisms, students proposed a statutory committee aimed to look into course, grading, supervisor and project feedback. Other demands included extension of hostel accommodation, modification of
M.Sc
. course work and offering alternatives to MTP 2. The panel acknowledged the suggestions but maintained that academic institutions must follow certain procedures established over the years to avoid counterproductive and irresponsible decisions. They promised to discuss the issues at the department level and with the senate. The panel agreed on the formation of a committee including student representatives and external members within a period of two weeks and committed to provide a written course of action for each of the demands by next Tuesday.
PhD
PhD Demands:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ml9XIuhjte8A4YUhPrzGYZDZCrRmnuqL/view?usp=sharing
The major issues raised by PhD scholars were in relation to their supervisors and the lack of flexibility with regards to choosing one. They asked for an initial period of lab rotation to familiarise themselves with the professors‚Äô conduct and research. They complained about the total lack of a work-life balance and a healthy social environment. Students suggested initiating an annual meet for research scholar.
Some of them claimed that their assigned leaves on paper were not respected by their supervisors, forcing scholars to be deprived of breaks from academic work, thus further deteriorating their mental health. Scholars complained about the absence of hostel accommodation following the submission of the PhD thesis. Scholars also complained of poor research infrastructure and reduced funding at CRF (Central Research Facility), HPC (High Performance Computing), etc including malfunctioning equipment and long job queues leading to delay in research work. They also complained that some supervisors are not sensitive to this limitation. Professor Ambuj argued that standardising PhD processes could be counterproductive to the diverse nature of the degree.
Undergraduate
UG Demands:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u7oVKcqb0bw3U121sVmAuQtpzEoROFzs/view?usp=sharing
Undergraduate demands centred around the stringent grading policies and the lack of transparency in the process of grade moderation. A Department Wellness Committee was proposed to counter social isolation demanding active participation from professors, a suggestion eagerly welcomed by the panel. Examination schedule and re-minor standardisation were other prominent woes. The director encouraged the students to devise better course and faculty feedback mechanisms than those currently in place. The students demanded to outsource the counselling services to an external body for improved quality and efficacy. They also raised concerns over the utter lack of transparency in the placement cell and demanded that all placement statistics report should be externally audited. Professor Suma Athreye reiterated the lack of a sense of community felt by students and the need of a support system that extends beyond the counselling services.
Questions raised by students
The house was opened for all students after the student representatives had voiced the popular concerns. There was an appeal by the students to set up an enquiry committee to carry out the investigation of student suicides that have occurred on campus in past few months. The Director was reluctant to commit to the committee's formation as he believed that it wouldn't add much value citing that it was not their area of expertise. Prof. Mittal shared that they were cooperating with the agencies in all ways possible and there was not much that they could do as suicide investigation is outside the institute‚Äôs jurisdiction. He went on to say that the Delhi High Court had passed a judgement on previous suicides stating, ‚ÄòAlthough unfortunate, nothing was found lawfully wrong and the court cannot proceed on emotions‚Äô. The panel acknowledged students‚Äô concerns about the lack of deadline extensions for BTPs, MTPs and assignments despite minors being postponed, committing to resolve the issue by Friday.
Academic professionalism and teaching competencies of professors
A suggestion for a customisable degree for students who couldn‚Äôt cope with their academics of the current programme was made. Questions were raised on the quality of teaching of IIT Delhi professors as dissatisfaction leads some students to resort to external sources for learning. Students tend to skip classes and mark proxies due to this. Instances of snide remarks by professors in classes were also reported which highlighted the insensitivity and lack of empathy of some professors towards mental health of students.
Concerns were also sighted regarding ineffective induction programme for PhD programme. The heavily mismanaged mentorship programme, lack of communication among students and academic information regarding courses was a major issue faced by the PhD freshers.
Overwhelming focus on placements
Students highlighted that the overwhelming focus on placements sidelined entrepreneurship and research. This leads to a rat race for CGPA and Positions of Responsibility (PORs) aggravating the stress for everyone. Once again, the lack of transparency in OCS and its policies were also deemed problematic by the students.
What Changed Since the Last Open House?
Prof. Rangan Banerjee, Director IIT Delhi, addressing the Open House
Student Counselling Services (SCS)
The number of counsellors available on campus has significantly increased to allow for round the clock access to services. IIT Delhi has collaborated with multiple nearby hospitals and an alumni venture, Disha Kiran to provide counselling services when internal counsellors are not available. However, students have a mixed opinion on the quality and utility of such services and BSP found widespread non-uniformity in treatment and experiences of students who have availed these services.
One-On-One Faculty Mentorship
The panel claimed that an academic progress group had been constituted for students with extended degrees and letters were sent to the guardians of such students. They were monitoring the attendance of such students and coordinating with Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA) to incorporate changes discussed in the previous open house. A ground-level enquiry by BSP found that academic advisors assigned to some students facing academic probation showed a lack of participation in the duties assigned leading to a disconnect. Moreover, students repeating an academic year have complained that they have not been assigned advisors revealing the vast gap between legislation and execution.
Standardised disclosure of course policy and other academic practices
In the previous open house, the panel said that the professors would henceforth be required to display the course policy on the ERP Portal during preregistration. Student experience reveals an alternate reality where the institute mandated policy is not followed by every professor. BSP also found out that for some courses, the course policy was not uploaded until the end of the add/drop window.
Conclusion
Though various issues were raised and multiple suggestions made, the administration did not commit to any concrete decision. The highlighted issues ranged from the work-life balance and mental health of postgraduates to a lack of empathy in a highly competitive environment. The administration pledged to improve community bonding, teaching standards, communication with professors as well as to reduce academic stress, and provide assistance to those struggling. While the efforts to enhance counselling services over the past few months were acknowledged, it was evident that the effectiveness of measures was in question and that further open houses required and there was still a long way to go before all the issues could be resolved.

Addressing the Inter IIT cultural meet fiasco
Introduction
As IIT Delhi was participating at the 56th Inter IIT sports meet jointly hosted by IIT Bombay and IIT Gandhinagar, another drama was unfolding closer at home. 260-odd students were confused and left in a dilemma of whether they would be going to represent IIT Delhi at the 6th Inter IIT cultural meet or not, to be hosted by IIT Kharagpur from 26th to 29th of December, 2023.
We reached out to the stakeholders concerned and pieced together what exactly happened in the upper echelons of BRCA.
What Happened
As per BRCA General Secretary, he was given confirmation of IIT Delhi‚Äôs participation in Inter IIT cultural meet by the administration on 28 October and tasked to book train tickets for the entire contingent by 10 November. The admin states that they have been prompt in sending out the audition forms the same day (4th November) as the structure and rules of the competitions were finalised by the host IIT. What was already an uphill task was made even more arduous by the limited time frame (26th to 29th is holiday season so tickets sell out quickly). Moreover, the administration had forbidden travelling in smaller groups citing that arriving in fragments doesn‚Äôt express solidarity as a contingent.
This was in contrast to what happened last year, where the contingent travelled in subgroups, which made it easier to arrange tickets. This restriction, combined with the small timeframe for bookings, made it nearly impossible to have a solution agreeable to all the stakeholders. The ADSE states that they had reached out to the BRCA requesting them to plan out the travel itinerary 50 days prior to the event. As per the General Secretary, he had to visit the IRCTC office several times to discuss possible arrangements but to no avail. Note that the idea of attaching additional coaches had not been discussed so far.
The administration immediately shot down the proposal to travel by bus due to safety concerns. As per our informant, it instead raised concerns about the contingent size. A smaller contingent would have significantly lowered the travel constraints. This proposal was rejected on grounds that it was impossible to cut down the size at such an advanced stage as preparations and practice were already in full swing. Moreover, the administration maintains that they have encouraged the students to participate by providing access to hostels for accommodation during winter break, providing venues for overnight practises and making sure that IIT Delhi is a part of the Inter IIT meetings for the cultural meet.
The administration states that a large and indecisive contingent made it difficult to book tickets after receiving confirmation from the host IIT. However, it seems like the idea of group tickets, although pointed out as a valid option by ADSE, was never entertained citing that the high premium or blocking a surplus number of tickets would be wasteful. The indecisiveness stems from the delay due to emphasis on transparency in the audition process for the contingent but how democratic BRCA clubs really are remains an unanswered question worth exploring.
This was when the BRCA GSec sent a text message on a Whatsapp group with different club secretaries, implying IIT Delhi might not be participating in Inter-IIT this year. It left several members of the contingent feeling disgruntled and frustrated towards what seemed like an administrative mismanagement. Some students, still on campus practising for various events, reluctantly booked tickets for home, wanting to spend what little vacation time they had left with their families instead. This was the situation last Tuesday before one of the contingent members took it upon themselves to figure out what was happening.
What it led to
After being informed of the possibility of cancellation of the cultural meet, one of the dramatics contingent members sent an email addressed to the director informing him about these developments. As told to BSP, he was informed to be present in a meeting that took place the following morning, i.e., December 13th at around 11 A.M., in the presence of the director, the Associate Dean (Student Events), the BRCA president, and the BRCA General Secretary.
After listening to the plight of the student, the director asked the Associate Dean (Student Events) to find out ways for the contingent to make it to the Inter IIT Cultural Meet.
According to what we have been told, the possibility of attaching extra coaches was explored only ten days before this meeting, and even then, the option to go in subgroups was frowned upon by the administration. The director assured the accommodation of students at IIT KGP who would reach on 21st and that travel arrangements by train would be made for 21st and 24th. Furthermore, the possibility of air travel was discussed as a backup for any remaining contingent members.
Our informant expressed a disconnect between the BRCA president and the General Secretary as their statements were not consistent with each other during the meeting. Our informant was informed of the hierarchy of administration by the Deans and how collective responsibility by the students, assisted by the structure of BRCA G. Secy. ‚Üí Vice President BRCA ‚Üí President BRCA ‚Üí ADSE ‚Üí Dean SA would have worked fine to avoid miscommunications. Much smoother BSA operations for the Inter IIT sports meet are an evidence of the same.
Questions Raised
Officially, Inter IIT cultural and tech meets are not recognised the same as the Inter-IIT sports meet (i.e., as official meets by the IIT council). The Dean SA explained that this means that the host IIT has no formal responsibility towards the event. He points out that last year‚Äôs meet at IIT Madras was mismanaged and had no proper closing ceremony or report. This made it difficult for IIT Delhi to justify the discomfort caused to participating students, leave alone the costs incurred. Compared to other IITs, IIT Delhi‚Äôs lacklustre performance (students had informed the administration that most of it was due to lack of ownership by the management at host IIT) in last year‚Äôs meet and a lack of sense of solidarity may also be noted as important points to keep in mind.
There seems to be an internal lack of coordination and delegation within the BRCA student heads. We reached out to this year‚Äôs Inter IIT contingent leader, who dismissed their involvement in making travel arrangements. It seems absurd that only the General Secretary was actively involved in making the travel arrangements for a contingent of 260-odd students. This allegation is in alignment with what the administration believes is a case of lack of initiative and collective student responsibility. Why were the administrative and logistical tasks not divided among the student heads?
MENTAL DISTRESS BORNE BY THE STUDENTS
Several students had already been staying on campus for practice, and many were supposed to reach campus this week through already booked flights and trains as nobody had been previously informed of the possibility of cancellation of IIT Delhi‚Äôs participation. Several BRCA club secretaries began to discuss travelling at personal expense with their subgroups so all their efforts did not go in vain.
All this indecisiveness led to mental and physical distress for the students who have still been reeling from the strenuous exam season and several tragedies during the semester. This should strike as particularly ironical as the whole point of these events is to enable students to relax and de-stress.
PARTING THOUGHTS
Taken together, it seems like the hassle created around the Inter IIT cultural meet transpired due to poor communication and misunderstanding which was avoidable. At the end of the day, we are forced to ask why the student bodies are so ineffective in fulfilling basic student demands that highest administrative offices have to be called to resolve every such need?

A Report on the Open House - 3rd September
BSP
Nov 16, 2023
4 min read
Introduction
An Open House was organised by the administration of IIT Delhi in response to calls by the students for an open discussion in light of the recent suicides in college. It was led by Professor Rangan Banerjee (Director), along with
Professor T.R. Sreekrishnan
(Deputy Director Operations), Professor Ambuj Sagar (Deputy Director, Strategy & Planning), Professor Narayan D Kurur (Dean, Academics), Professor Aditya Mittal (Dean, Student Affairs),  Professor Angelie Multani (Dean, Diversity, and Inclusion) and Professor S. Chatterjee (Associate Dean Curriculum). It was held on September 3, in the Open Air Theater (OAT) of IIT Delhi‚Äôs Student Activity Centre (SAC) from 17:00 to 19:00 hours. There were hundreds of students in attendance, from all departments, years, and specialities along with professors from various departments. Several issues concerning mental health of the student community in IIT Delhi were raised, and answers sought from the administration. The objective of the Open House was to hear students‚Äô concerns, and seek potential solutions to address them.
Concerns raised by the students and response by panel
Student Counselling Services (SCS)
There were concerns raised by a large number of students highlighting the inefficiency, and incompetence of the Student Counselling Services (SCS) at IIT Delhi. Several students shared personal anecdotes about the apathy of the counsellors and the psychiatrist at IIT Delhi Hospital. There were also grievances about the lack of 24x7 assistance to the students, and the small number of counsellors in comparison to the student population. The students demanded an accountability mechanism for the counselling team and an increase in the number of counsellors to be able to cater to the big student population.
The Panel responded by saying that the Institute is already on lookout for new counsellors and plans on increasing the number in the team. They recently hired a couple new psychiatrists as well to increase availability of their services to the students on campus. They emphasised that the process could not be rushed, and that they would look into alternate measures to help provide help to the students in the meantime. They admitted the need to have a system of checks and balances in place for the counselling system and pledged to work on the same.
Number of Yearbacks (One on One Faculty Mentorship)
There were 26 students in the 2019 batch of B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing, out of which two have committed suicide in the last three months. The crowd questioned how the students who come here after qualifying one of the most difficult exams become so incompetent that around 25% of the batch is not able to pass in the allocated time. They sought measures to help guide these students, and provide options to help them complete their degree in the smallest possible time frame.
The Panel responded by saying that they had restarted One on One Faculty advising and mentorship for such students who were struggling to pass their courses and complete the requirements for an undergraduate degree. The system had been shut up during the pandemic and had only recently been brought back up.
A professor, who is also a faculty advisor, said from the audience that the Mentorship system has a long way to go right now, and is hardly up and running. He mentioned that he and his colleagues had to cater to a large number of students as there were a small number of faculty advisors available. He emphasised the need for proper training for such advisors, and a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) in place for the same.
Uniformity in Grades Moderation
Unreliable grading moderation was another issue raised by the students, and was said to be a big cause of academic pressure in the community. Some students alleged that there were certain professors in the Institute who purposefully pass only a small minority of class, year after year. The students questioned how this was allowed to take place by the Admin, and why there were no measures to contain such blatant abuse of power over the students. There were questions about professors changing the course policy mid-course, and giving extremely poor grades on Average marks, instead of a 7 that is warranted on average performance.
Dean of Academics, Professor Narayan D. Kurur responded by saying that it was only the first year courses that came under the purview of his office, and the courses from second year onwards were audited and moderated by the departments itself. He insisted that there were discussions at the end of every year, and the students were welcome to voice their opinions on the matter. The Associate Dean of Curriculum, Professor S. Chatterjee, also mentioned that there was no provision that allowed professors to change their course policy mid semester, and that his office should be made aware of the same if this happens. The professors are mandated to upload the course policy on the Academic ERP before the Add/Drop deadline, and the students are advised to flag the course if this is not being done.
The director, Professor Rangan Banerjee said that there are no professors that take pleasure in the student‚Äôs misery, and that they frequently work on adjusting policies so that more and more students are able to pass the course on their own merit, in as few tries as possible.
Conclusion
No conclusive answers were given by the administration for most of the questions, and it reiterates the point that we are a long distance from solving all the issues plaguing the mental health of students in a premier institution of the country. There were issues highlighted from the dire straits of the counselling services, to poor living arrangements, unreliable support systems and the ever increasing academic pressure on students. The Panel advised the students to look out for their friends and reach out to them in case of any academic or non-academic pressure that they could provide assistance for. The meeting ended with a lot of unanswered questions and the Panel vowed to hold more open houses in the future to listen to the needs and demands of the students.

Accessibility in IIT Delhi - Special Issue: World Disability Day
BSP
Dec 3, 2022
11 min read
Updated:
Dec 6, 2022
A closer look at the experiences of PwD students in IIT Delhi and the role of the newly established Office of Diversity and Inclusion and Office of Accessible Education in enriching their lives on campus.
World Disability Day is celebrated across the globe on the 3rd of December to foster support for people with disability and promote a deeper understanding of their experiences and struggles. Many of us are fortunate enough to go through life without experiencing such limitations, which makes it even more integral for us to lend empathetic ears when they come forward to talk about their journey. IIT Delhi has a population of about 200 PwD students each year. It also has a newly established Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) and an Office of Accessible Education (OAE), the orientation for which was held recently.
In this piece, BSP tries to delve deeper into the lives of people with disabilities living on campus and the accessibility provided to them by the university. We at BSP covered the orientation and get-together of the OAE and talked to Dean ODI and Faculty Advisor PwD. We inquired about their respective undertakings concerning alleviating the issues faced by these students. We also approached the students themselves, who were willing to contribute to the discussion and help us gather a myriad of opinions and perspectives about their journey with IIT Delhi.
A growing mindset, enriched with inclusivity and awareness, has helped advance the progress and growth of people with disabilities in society and on campus. However, several problems also came to light, which we hope will reach a greater spectrum of the IITD population through this article and change the general perception and understanding of disabilities.
The orientation and get-together
The orientation of the Office of Accessible Education, OAE, IIT Delhi, for the PwD students was held on November 27, 2022, in the Seminar Hall. This also served as a meet-up for the students as they shared their problems and experiences on campus.
Drishty Sharma, from the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ODI IIT Delhi, was the host of the event. Prof. Vikram Singh, the faculty advisor to OAE, introduced the staff- Amrita, Monu Kumar, Akhil, and Rakhi, all of whom work day and night to make the lives of the PwD students easier, followed by a brief note on the purpose of OAE. OAE was established under the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to create an accessible and friendly environment for everyone on the campus. It works to provide a healthy campus life and caters to the academic needs, examinations, placements, and more of the differently abled students. The OAE Office is situated behind SCOOPS and is accessible to all, and they soon plan to shift to the ground floor of LHC for improved accessibility.
Many faculty members who have actively contributed to making the campus more accessible and enhancing the lives of PwD students were also present at the get-together. These include Prof. Gourab Kar from the Department of Design, who has been extremely instrumental in helping with the infrastructure audits of the institute, and Prof. PVM Rao from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Design, who has helped design various assistive devices. Sarita Chand, the founder of Indic AI, an NGO that works to ensure placements for students with disabilities, was also present, and she motivated the students to take up jobs and placements. Her NGO has placed nearly 50 students in the past six months, and they also work to get scholarships for students at various colleges, including Ivy League colleges.
All the student bodies of the institute- SAC, BSW, BSP, BRCA and BSA were introduced to the students by secretaries and representatives, and discussions were held on how to make them more inclusive for the students. After the orientation, an informal discussion session was organized for the students, wherein they shared personal experiences from their stay at the institute. Deepak, an assistant professor at Motilal University and a student in the Humanities Department of IIT Delhi, motivated students to speak up and take charge of their lives. He is a resident of Zanskar Hostel and suffers from vision impairment, and many students look up to him as a mentor. He talked about how we are all "Temporarily Abled Bodies", and that normal is different for everyone.
Different students spoke about the various obstacles they face in their daily lives. Those with hearing impairment reported a common issue: the speakers in LHC produce distorted voices, creating difficulties for them in understanding lectures. The introduction of masks during COVID also made lip-reading difficult for them. Other major issues that the students raised were the inaccessibility of the second floor of the library, the absence of braille script in the touch-sensitive lifts, and the accessibility of the washing machines for visually impaired students, amongst some other issues.
To find out more about the issues faced by the specially-abled students and hear a more personal account of their experiences at IIT Delhi, BSP approached some of the PwD students on campus.
Disability Awareness Week
The commencement of Disability Week 2022 was marked with a sensitisation camp put up by the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). The camp was about sensitising people about their peers with disabilities, and they chose to do so by making the onlookers experience their struggle and the underlying dysphoria and provide a glimpse into what their thoughts on generic things would be like on an everyday basis.
On December 2, interactive stalls were set up near Amul to educate the general public about the issues that specially-abled students face. In an institute known for its eminence in education, the OAE has to take emphatic measures to increase empathy in the student and faculty bodies.
The volunteers for the event set up a series called 'Challenging Challenges', where passers-by could participate in activities that test your sensory processing capacity‚Äîhow well you are able to access any form of information with some hindrance attached‚Äîand highlight how those two minutes of inconvenience are someone's daily routine, perhaps for a lifetime.
We all know we should not make fun of them but help them, yet only after experiencing their struggles can one relate better to them.
A sheet chock full of colours and pictures, while irritating to us on a regular day, is a daily struggle for those with autism. A blindfolded individual, even with a vibrating cane, struggled to walk a short distance conveniently. Mirrored handwriting, struggling with memorisation, stuttering in speech, and even having impaired hearing are issues that many face regularly, and the stalls compressed that experience into 2 minutes and gave people some food for thought. A badge advocating inclusivity was also distributed. Along with these activities, a few devices like braille and magnifying lenses were also on display.
The attempt here is to merely elevate awareness to improve the availability of resources for those who cannot access them as easily as others.
The problems faced by PwD students
We asked some students about the problems they faced on campus. Many concurred that as there are still few facilities available to accommodate the PwD students adequately, the problems begin even before enrollment. Some PwD students find it challenging to access campus buildings due to their layout and design, particularly the Lecture Halls and the hostels. ‚ÄúThe Lecture Halls are too steep. Many hostels lack lifts. Those that are available are less spacious. It is often difficult to even enter the lift‚Äù, noted Dhananjay, an undergrad from the CSE department. He also emphasized how it is challenging to meet with friends in various hostels and attend lectures in the LHC because of the lack of accessibility.
Additionally, there is an unresolved communication gap between the professors and the teaching assistants, and the students. Thyagraj, a sophomore in the Production and Industrial Department, informed us of the same: "The lecture hall microphones produce sound at various frequencies. Some professors also wear masks when lecturing, lowering their sound volume by 5 to 6 decibels.‚Äù He further explained, "Programs in hearing aids amplify particular sounds in accordance with their volume and frequency. As a result, I frequently find myself unable to understand what the lecturer is saying because I cannot hear him speak or because other amplified background noises make it impossible to grasp what he is saying.‚Äù
Thyagraj further described that during the first year, when most of the coursework was completed online, he used to think that his issue was primarily individualistic. "At first, I refrained from expressing my concerns because I hesitated to request extra accommodations. I only realized this was a widespread problem once I spoke with other students in my third semester.‚Äù
Akashdeep, a PhD student in the CSE department, highlighted the difficulty in accessing the institute's internet platforms. "I use a screen reader to use my laptop with ease. However, IITD websites like E-academics and Moodle cannot be accessed using the same, making it extremely difficult for me to submit anything on these portals.‚Äù
Interactions with the IITD Community
PwD students have a generally positive attitude toward student interaction. They find it relatively easy to communicate with their friends and classmates, who are generally kind and accommodating. However, there are still places that require more effort.
‚ÄúThe problem with the IITD student community is that they are highly unaware,‚Äù observed Akashdeep. He added that even the most basic extracurricular activities and college festivals exhibit this ignorance.
Many club activities are inaccessible to PwD students because of the skill set demanded. People with hearing impairment, for example, find it difficult to communicate offline in large groups and avoid activities that require them to pay close attention to what others are saying. ‚ÄúThere is a high chance of misinterpretation, and with it comes the fear of being sidelined, so I just avoid participating in such events,‚Äù explained Thyagraj. Various sports activities also don't include people with disabilities, and even small details, like the timings of college events, matter since they are typically held at night, making them inaccessible to those with vision impairments.
Literature PhD student Deepak Kumar explained to BSP the need for sensitizing students regarding the terminologies used to address PwD students. Even if the IITD group does not discriminate, their terminology might. Deepak shed light on this frequently disregarded topic. ‚ÄúThe disabled are commonly referred to as 'divyang', 'specially-abled', or 'differently abled'. These terms are problematic as they tend to attribute some special abilities to the disability, differentiating such people from the perception of ‚Äònormal.‚Äô Terms like ‚Äòvisually impaired‚Äô are better, as they acknowledge the disability."
There, however, is a sense of pity for PwD students that the community does not find motivating. Interacting with someone only as someone who needs help or assistance ends up making that person uncomfortable and reclusive. It also contributes to the hesitation of many PwD students to express their worries. "There is a need to break this notion that a disabled person only needs help," Deepak noted. "We enjoy the same things, such as relationships, movies, chilling out, just that our methods are different."
"Sensitive and sensible wording towards the people being addressed to, directly or indirectly, is required," explained Deepak. But that rarely seems to be the case. In some instances, TAs address students under the assumption that they are not PwD and unintentionally hurt their sentiments. "Hearing loss is a disability that is not immediately apparent. I've sometimes asked the TAs, unaware of my disability, to repeat instructions, and they have replied, "Can't you hear?" It stings, even if it isn't deliberate," expressed Thyagraj.
Our conversation with Dean ODI and Faculty Advisor PwD
We use PowerPoints, and we say things like, "As you can see", we speak to students and say, "Can't you hear me?" or "Everybody who wants this, raise your hand." This is all extremely privileged, ableist vocabulary.
We at BSP spoke to
Professor Angelie Multani, Dean ODI
and
Professor Vikram Singh, Faculty Advisor OAE
, to gain a deeper insight into the vision that guides the OAE and the primary challenges they are currently facing. The following summarises all the critical lessons and takeaways from the extremely thought-provoking conversation with the professors.
Did you know that the construction metrics on our campus, like the height of the shelves in the hostels, are all standard as per the appropriate metrics for able-bodied men? Or that the parking spaces reserved for people with disabilities are almost always occupied by others? Why does the concept of equity and inclusion appear as a follow-up question and not as an elementary discourse that guides our infrastructure and decision-making? It is vital to have accessible routes to central places on campus and provide convenient living spaces for all. Accessible education is a top priority, and focus is being given to technologies like screen readers, text-to-speech software, assistive hearing aids, and wheelchairs.
This material assistance, although crucial and transformative, is the first of many requirements to increase awareness and sensitisation on campus. Take, for instance, the fact that the 2018 agenda to build a ramp up to the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs remains unaccomplished. Or that none of the college festivals you've been to have recognised inclusivity or equity for students with disabilities. Or that, while compensatory time and more accessible document features are provided, our lectures are still conducted with the presumptuous supposition of complete visibility, audibility, and understanding. Visibility itself is a very ableist concept in the sense that we take it for granted and conduct our daily routines without sparing a thought to it. Disabilities are diverse, and disabilities are not always visible. There is much talk of equity and sensitivity. Yet, the pressures of our schedule, coupled with the rapidly closing elevator doors, enforce a sense of oblivious urgency that makes us neglect every single person beside us, whether they are standing, limping, or sitting in a wheelchair. When we can cut the line, we ignore the vivacious posters and our conscientious yearnings and do so. Obtaining CSR funding and mobilising support from existing bodies is difficult, but eventually, they will be the easier parts of the job. It is tough to reinvent and modify existing cultures. That is, essentially, the job.
It's hilarious how our ignorance peaks, except when it concerns us. Consider the perpetual debate regarding the differential treatment of students based on their academic performance, which brings us back to the very restrained way we define and interpret 'merit'. The initial months of the first year of engineering are spent rather hastily; we leap into the bubbling pot of entropy that surrounds our rank, our marks, and our estimations of our CGPA. The hierarchies of 'machau', 'kholu', 'dhakkan' are irreversibly impregnated in our brains. We wish to be different, yet we also want to blend into the community to a certain extent because no student wants to be picked out. Identity and stigmatisation have become very convoluted, significantly aided by our insecurities. It is safe to argue that a lot of the differential treatment of students with disabilities arises from a sense of justice or fairness.
Regarding fairness, a very interesting perspective on this would be to spend a few hours with one lesser, undervalued comfort and judge if there was any discrepancy in who worked harder or spent more hours studying. The lesson of extending one's judgement of oneself beyond numerical parameters and understanding that one's value to this society extends beyond one's ability to solve a given set of scientific problems on one day is a lesson that must be actualised by the entire community. The passion for striving for equity and equality must circumvent the thought process of equalising everything else in the past and bearing hostilities that limit one's own life.
Infrastructure, recreation, and mindset: these are the three key elements that guide the OAE. It is an extremely important office in the sense that it achieves a representation of identity instead of a representation of individuals. The responsibilities it must grapple with are varied and huge because it must work towards restructuring and reinvigorating many systemic and ideological flaws that we mistake for normal ways of living. The dream is to achieve an inclusive, sensitised, and advocative campus culture that eliminates the need for the Office. The dream is to literally take for granted today what we fail to recognise and to be able to live, breathe, and innovate without asking the two questions, "Will I be able to? Will they let me?" The Office of Accessible Education will be truly successful the day there is no separation in the community between ability and disability, but instead an acceptance and celebration of all identities.
When asked about whether empathy or sympathy will guide the outlook of the ODI, Professor Multani responded by saying,
‚ÄùWe're not reaching out and saying, "Let us help you." This is our responsibility. At the very least, it's an obligation.‚Äù
Concluding Remarks
At this critical juncture in history, when we value and support inclusivity and diversity, we must create a welcoming and understanding environment for our PwD friends. The Office of Accessible Education and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion have been established to ensure that IIT Delhi is aware and sensitised, and that appropriate measures are taken to support the people with disability. A vivid and exhaustive orientation was held where students were familiarised with student boards like BSW, BRCA, BSP, and BSA. Everybody at these offices strives to develop an environment where equality is not a peripheral thought but an idea that drives and influences our lives and decisions. While some efforts have been made to make the daily lives of PwD students at IIT Delhi easier, many problems still need to be addressed, and there is a long way to go. We hope that the newly established offices succeed in making IIT Delhi a safe and accessible workplace for all students.

Lead Poisoning Report - by iGEM IITD
BSP
Oct 5, 2022
4 min read
Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth‚Äôs crust in very low proportions. Due to its widespread use, there have been serious public health issues, environmental damage, and human exposure in many different parts of the world.
Lead can have harmful effects on one's health even at low concentrations. When lead accumulates in the body, frequently over months or years, it can lead to a serious issue of lead poisoning.
iGem IIT Delhi recently surveyed 80+ IITD students to assess lead poisoning awareness in the IITD community; The survey was conducted with the purpose of assessing the current level of understanding regarding lead poisoning and to spread awareness about it.
The findings suggested a concerning level of unawareness in the community about the sources of lead exposure and the harmful consequences of its prolonged exposure.
Lead: Is it a nutrient?
Nutrients are substances used by the body for growth and maintenance. Lead is toxic in nature and isn‚Äôt required by the body. 84.1 % of respondents also feel the same, but it‚Äôs shocking to know that around 15.9 % of the people taking this survey from the top technological institution in the country believe otherwise.
Lead: How lethal is it !?
Around 2.3% of people believe that Lead is not dangerous at all. It‚Äôs glad that only 2.3% of the 15.9% of people who believed lead was a nutrient believe lead is harmless assuming that the people who believe lead not to be a nutrient definitely don‚Äôt see it as harmless.
While the rest believe lead is toxic, they don‚Äôt think that it makes the top cut.
Do you know someone who had tested themselves for lead poisoning?
This question was intended to spread awareness amongst the masses about lead poisoning and the low rate of testing in India. 93.2% of people have never encountered anyone who has undergone testing for lead poisoning. This figure is alarming as various reports have shown that Lead poisoning is quite common in India, and so there seems to be a low rate of testing in the test group.
Is there a cure for Lead Poisoning?
The opinions on this question seem to be split evenly, with 44.3% of the people believing the disease to be non-curable.
While 55.7% of the people correctly believe that there is a cure for lead poisoning.
One of the common cures is EDTA-based chelation therapy. Depending on the severity of exposure, lead poisoning can be treated accordingly; therefore, detection at the primary stages is of utmost importance. Still, current detection methods are only available at high-end labs, so iGem IIT Delhi trying to create a biosensor quantifying lead which is relatively cheap and has the potential to be used at the decentralised level.
Have you checked your water supply for leaded pipes?
Only a tiny fraction of 4.5% of people have their pipes checked, while most people are unaware whether their water supply pipes are leaded or not.
This question was intended to make people question whether their water supply had leaded pipes, potentially exposing them to lead. There was an image attached with the instructions to perform a simple test to check for leaded pipes.
Are paints used in whitewashing can be a source of Lead Poisoning?
59.1% of people strongly agreed that paints used for homes contain lead and can be a potential source of lead poisoning.
35.2% of people were unsure about the same, while a very small fraction of people denied paints to be harmful.
Lead is added to paint to speed up drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. India banned lead-based paints in 2016, following the footsteps of countries like the USA, Sweden, etc. Still, some paint manufacturers use lead in their paint. This question was intended to make people consider whether the paint used for whitewashing their homes was lead-based or not. Since 35.3% of people never thought about paint as a potential source, there seems to be a serious requirement for spreading awareness about it.
Can exposure to Lead lead to anti-social behaviour?
A fair share, 65.9% of respondents, agreed that exposure to lead could cause antisocial behaviour in people.
A key symptom of lead poisoning is depression and irritability. The respondents show a good awareness of it, yet when discussing anti-social behaviour lead poisoning is often overlooked.
Is someone who is using ammunition exposed to Lead poisoning?
59.1% of respondents agreed that people who use ammunition are exposed to lead poisoning.
Bullets used in shooting ranges are made up of lead. When those bullets are fired, lead fumes are emitted, leading to exposure to lead amongst the people associated with those shooting ranges.
Do you live with someone directly exposed to Lead as a part of their job? (Defence ammunition, Fishers, Hunters, Construction workers, painters, mechanics, electricians, makes ceramics, pottery, stained glass or jewellery)
83% of the respondents replied negative to the above question, this shows that occupation might not be the major reason for exposure in India.
Lead exposure occurs in the workplace in a number of professions. This raises the likelihood that workers and their loved ones will suffer from lead poisoning. In India, occupation contracts often neglect the effect of exposure. This question was intended to make people introspect if they know someone who can be at risk of lead exposure due to the occupation of their known ones.
83% of the respondents replied negatively to the above question.
Can Eating Food Packed in Newspapers Expose You to Lead Poisoning?
42% of people replied with Yes, while 19.3% believed that packing food in newspapers cannot expose you to lead poisoning. Rest were unsure.
The printing ink used in newspapers contains lead, so when the food is wrapped in newspapers, the food picks up the ink and exposes consumers to lead poisoning. In 2016, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued a pan-India advisory, banning newspapers from being used for wrapping food items. However, we know that food is still being packed in newspapers in India. Given that nearly 1 in 5 people think otherwise, there seems to be a serious lack of awareness.

Dearth, Distance & Discouragement: Behind the Underwhelming Participation of Women in Sports at IITD
Mariya Ezzy
Jun 4, 2022
9 min read
Sports activities have been an integral part of life in IITD for a long time. The BSA grounds are perpetually bustling with the energy and fervour of the passionate sportspersons playing their favourite sports. Since the introduction of the supernumerary seats for women in 2017, the proportion of women on campus has drastically increased. The scheme was modified in 2021, allowing each IIT to autonomously decide the number of seats reserved for women while ensuring a minimum enrollment of 20%. However, this change has not yet percolated to the sports community at IITD, and the participation of women in sports in the institute continues to be significantly low. Be it the lack of incentives or the stereotypical gender roles imposed by society, many systemic issues have led to an inhibitory atmosphere for the improvement of women‚Äôs participation in sports activities.
BSP decided to delve deeper into this alarming issue by finding its primary causes. In our investigation, we approached the students to determine the reasons behind the problem and the steps taken to improve the situation. We inquired the administration and the Board for Sports Activities (BSA) about their roles in changing the status quo and the progress being made in encouraging more women to participate.
As we enhanced our knowledge of the fundamental barriers to the participation of women, we came across some facts that we had expected, some thoughts that we could rationalise and other simply troubling opinions. From the myriad of viewpoints that we gathered, we could finally paint a comprehensive picture of the matter.
The Status Quo
To gain a deeper insight into the sub-optimal participation of women in sports, we conducted a survey that received 167 responses, a majority (54.7%) of which were from people who identified as female. We reached out to students, sports captains, coaches and the administration as well in an effort to understand the various factors that come into play and to begin developing a feasible solution.
One of the biggest problems faced by women looking to venture into sports at IIT is that there is a significant lack of incentive for them. This opinion was mirrored by 52% of the survey respondents, who identified this as a primary reason for the lower participation of women. Sports like cricket, hockey, football and weightlifting do not have a women‚Äôs team and are not a part of the prestigious Inter-IIT tournament. With no official team and no competitive matches, many people find no encouragement to play the sport of their choice in IITD. For example, a limited number of cricket games are held annually, which isn‚Äôt enough to garner interest in the sport. The recent establishment of the women‚Äôs football team is a step in the right direction; however, there is still a long way to go before the team is made official at the institute and Inter-IIT levels.
Another prominent issue that we identified was the distance of the sports facilities from the girls‚Äô hostels, particularly the volleyball and lawn tennis courts, and the Student Activity Center (SAC), which houses indoor sports like swimming, badminton, table tennis, squash etc. Many of the people we interviewed and surveyed suggested that the long commute is fatiguing and time-consuming, acting as a deterrent for those interested in playing these sports. Extended practices held in the latter half of the day, along with the long commute, often make it difficult for them to have their dinner in the mess.
Furthermore, we also noticed that the lack of women coaches presents itself as an issue. Almost 40% of the respondents felt that some female players do not feel comfortable confiding in male coaches about missing practice due to menstruation, among other topics.
Some of the issues we recognised resonated strongly with all our respondents and were not limited to just women‚Äôs participation in sports. Nearly 53% of the students answered that they are discouraged from participating in sports because the fields are mostly occupied by the institute teams. Excessive importance is awarded to these teams who tend to have a monopoly on the equipment and courts. Consequently, people looking to try out a sport for the first time or just play it casually are often overlooked.
Lastly, while many of the issues were specific to IITD, some problems go beyond our institute. Boys, in general, have been encouraged to play sports since their childhood, while some girls were not. A quarter of the students claimed that families discourage women from participating in sports. This sentiment was mirrored by some people we interviewed, who cited the risk of injuries as the reason. This highlights the prevalent mindset among society about sports being an unsuitable activity for women, which perpetuates their meagre participation.
The Role of BSA
As the apex student body for managing all sports activities on campus, BSA has a fundamental role in ensuring equal opportunities and access to sports facilities irrespective of gender. To get insights into BSA‚Äôs work and contribution towadrs bridging this gender gap, we approached the current BSA General Secretary, Harsh Pratap Singh, for an interview.
Harsh reiterated that the most glaring issue that discourages the participation of women in sports is the lack of incentives. Since some women‚Äôs sports are not conducted in Inter-IIT, women do not have any prestigious tournament to target. On the other hand, to introduce a new event in Inter-IIT, many IITs have to guarantee their participation. This forms a vicious cycle that prevents the introduction of new events.
BSA is actively taking initiatives toward increasing the participation of women in sports. Recently, the board organised an informal Women‚Äôs Cricket League in IIT Delhi‚Äôs annual sports fest, Sportech. The matches were in the tennis ball cricket format to ensure that new players also participated in large numbers in the league. The tournament was very well received, and there was enough participation to form 4 teams. Consequently, the administration approved conducting trials for women‚Äôs cricket in the grand inter-hostel tournament, the General Championship (GC). However, the plan had to be postponed due to the cancellation of the GC during the pandemic. Similarly, BSA also organised informal women‚Äôs football matches. Despite a lot of publicity, the participation was limited and conducting only 5v5 matches was feasible. Interestingly though, this was the most liked BSA Instagram post.
The overall participation is much better in non-team sports like athletics. There are no significant differences between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs participation in these sports in most cases, except for the lack of specific events
in Inter-IIT for women due to lesser involvement.
Regarding the issue of separate coaches for women, Harsh stated that BSA had approached the administration about the same, but the proposal was not approved. The administration cited the instability due to Coronavirus and reduced boards' funding to defer the initiative. In addition, they argued that the participation of women was still meagre and fluctuating, which did not justify the appointment of new separate coaches.
After talking to students, sports captains and representatives, we realised that many of the problems we identified require the approval or permission of the administration. Thus, our next step was to approach the Sports Officer, Dr Deepak Negi, to investigate the issues further.
The Role of the Administration
Our discussion with Dr Deepak Negi gave us an overview of the history of female participation and performance in sports at IIT Delhi, highlighting the reforms taken to accommodate a fairer proportion of women in the institute sports scenario. Cognizant of the skewed sex ratio in the Inter-IIT contingent over the years, the administration introduced a new system consisting of a separate women‚Äôs contingent
around 2015-16. The team structure has witnessed a spectacular boost from a 10-membered, all-male contingent to separate male and female contingents consisting of 135 and 40 people respectively. Certain sports that were earlier deemed ‚Äúunsuitable‚Äù and ‚Äúnot physically feasible‚Äù for women, including the 800m flat race and high jump, have been extended to the female population. There are still certain sports, including cricket and weightlifting, that are unavailable for women. Nevertheless, the administration is optimistic about participation being extended to them in the upcoming years.
Concerning the provision of sports facilities and their quality, the administration claims that they have not demonstrated any shortcomings. The new Mittal Sports Complex has been optimally constructed at an equal distance from boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô hostel areas and is equipped with state-of-the-art sporting facilities. Regardless of whether this was a deliberate decision on the administration‚Äôs part, the fact remains that the sports grounds, which will not be accommodated inside the new complex, such as tennis, volleyball and basketball courts, continue to be situated at a fairly inconvenient distance for women. The authorities strive to provide supreme quality sports equipment without any discrimination to all students and staff belonging to the institute, including providing aid to the Board for Hostel Management (BHM) responsible for managing sports goods at the hostel level. The admin is apprehensive about including female coaches in the institute; however, we were not provided further clarification in this regard.
We have recorded substantial efforts and refinements in the sports structure of the institute in general, with particular emphasis on the participation and situation of females in sports. However, while the administration may be content with the current level of involvement and accolades garnered by women in sports, we believe there is still scope for improvement. Women's stagnant and saturated state of affairs in sports needs a boost in participation, quality and quantity of equipment, as well as mentorship. Attending to general inconveniences that bar them from participating, including logistics and the reception by others, is crucial.
Perspective of Coaches
Sports coaches work closely with the players, and their perspective on the participation of women, or the lack thereof, is crucial for a thorough analysis of the situation. With this objective, we approached the squash coach, Mr Aakash, for his stance on the issue.
From Aakash sir, we learnt that the women‚Äôs squash team was formed recently in 2019. Their premier year witnessed a spectacular performance, highlighted by winning the silver medal in the Inter-IIT tournament. Unfortunately, the very next year, in 2020, sports activities got suspended due to the pandemic, which halted further growth of the squash culture in women.
While 15 girls participated in squash trials this year, only 6 to 7 committed to the game and regularly came for practice. In comparison, there was more than double the turnout for the men‚Äôs team. Nonetheless, the coach noted that the skills of women players were in no way inferior to that of men, announcing that one female student recently reached the finals of the Gujarat Open Tournament.
On being asked about the reasons for dismal participation numbers, he told us that many IITs still don't have a women‚Äôs squash team. Accordingly, there are fewer women‚Äôs matches. Although supernumerary seats have improved participation numbers, not everyone who comes for the trials commits to the sport in the long run.
Regarding international comparisons with universities like Harvard and Princeton, he elaborated that foreign institutes usually have 15 players each in the men's and women‚Äôs teams. In contrast, IIT Delhi has only three players in the institute team, out of which two spots are reserved for the senior players. Thus, only one new player essentially gets selected for the team each year; ergo, the incentive to participate sincerely is extremely low. He believes that participation can be somewhat improved if there are at least five spots in the institute team. All in all, Aakash sir reiterated the importance of increasing opportunities to incentivise the increasing participation of women in sports.
Sexism in Responses
While going through the survey responses, a few comments left us concerned. Although we acknowledge that they do not represent the majority of the IITD community, we felt it essential to highlight them as they are also a part of the problem.
Some students commented that women‚Äôs sports aren‚Äôt up to the quality of men‚Äôs sports and that the difference in physical strengths between men and women is why women‚Äôs sports aren‚Äôt given the same importance. Some even went so far as to state that women don‚Äôt know how to play sports. ‚ÄúModern girls‚Äù were also blamed for the decreasing participation of women in physical activities, as ‚Äúthey will not drop their phones to burn out some calories on the ground‚Äù.
These statements and opinions, albeit rare, represent the very societal status quo that we as an institute are trying to break. They depict how essential it is to continue on this path of promotion and growth of women‚Äôs sports in our institute.
Concluding Remarks:
While IIT Delhi has taken some steps to improve women‚Äôs participation in sports, a lot still needs to be done. Through our survey and interviews, we received suggestions about initiatives that the institute or BSA can undertake to further encourage women to pursue sports. The crux of the entire problem is the vicious cycle formed due to low participation and lack of incentives. The sports authorities of all IITs need to correspond with each other to introduce new women‚Äôs events in the Inter-IIT tournament to break this cycle.
Since there are only two girls' hostels, the competition in inter-hostel sporting leagues is not at par with boys. Thus, women‚Äôs sports competitions should be held in different formats which include, but are not limited to, combined UG and PG events or leagues with multiple teams from each hostel. Seperate female coaches may also be appointed to encourage more students to participate.
In sports that do have a flourishing culture and an official team, amateur players can be assigned slots separate from the rigorous practices to try out a sport and play casually. This will help eliminate the hindrances posed by unavailablity of the fields and the intimidation felt by them due to the skills of advanced players. Additionally, the institute can improve the maintenance of sports equipment and fields. This will bolster participation in all sports across all genders.
Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, it is essential that these sensitive issues continue to find a voice in the institute. Although we are moving in the right direction with efforts being made to bridge the gap between male and female participation, the prevailing mindset of sports not being a suitable activity for women is detrimental to an inclusive sports culture in the institute.

Behind The Scenes: How Dil Mil‚Äôs Inclusion in RDV Turned into a Questionable Saga of its Own
Mariya Ezzy
May 4, 2022
9 min read
For three whole days last week, all of IIT Delhi was immersed in the festivities of Rendezvous: the offline fest we‚Äôd been waiting for for over two years. The preparation on the backend, however, had been going on for much longer. To pull off a fest as big as Rendezvous involves months of hard work, dedicated effort by a huge organising team and most importantly, enormous monetary support from an army of sponsors.
In this particular edition of RDV, certain sponsorship deals came under the lens and raised many eyebrows as students clashed with the marketing team. Many students pointed out that some contractual obligations and deliverables were inappropriate and problematic. Soon various student bodies got involved, complaints were raised, and the administration had to finally step in to resolve the issues. The issue we refer to, as the entire student body is now aware, is the sponsorship deal with the Dil Mil app.
The Timeline
Dil Mil was announced as one of the official sponsors (‚ÄúOfficial Dating Partner‚Äù) of Rendezvous 2022 on 8 April. It was also the exclusive sponsor for two highly anticipated events: ‚ÄúSpeed Dating‚Äù and ‚ÄúProm Night‚Äù. Dil Mil is a South Asian dating application catering only to Indian women and NRI men, which claims to be the ‚Äúmost efficient and advanced South Asian matchmaking platform‚Äù on its website.
As the preparations for the fest were in full swing, registration forms for Rendezvous events of the Quizzing Club were released. In those forms, a compulsory clause was to download Dil Mil, make a profile, and upload the screenshots of one‚Äôs profile to be able to participate in any given event. Certain external participants raised concerns in their quizzing circles, which then reached members of Indradhanu, the queer collective of IIT Delhi.
At the time, Indradhanu was already working on getting the posters for Rendezvous‚Äô prom night changed; these posters featured a heterosexual couple, and the forms had to be compulsorily filled by girls, effectively excluding couples of certain sexual orientations. They approached the RDV organising team, who agreed to change the posters and allow entries of people from all sexual orientations and gender identities in the event.
As this was transpiring, a meeting was held in SAC, as informed by an attendee, where all the female BRCA representatives and Activity Heads were instructed to download and create profiles on the Dil Mil app. Some students raised concerns and expressed discomfort; however, few took up the issue. When approached, the coordinators passed the issue on to the Core Team Members (CTMs); however, no prompt action was taken. The team continued to emphasise that downloading and registering on the app was mandatory for all.
Soon there were reports and rumours of a clause in the MoU signed with Dil Mil in which the RDV team promised new
female
registrations on the Dil Mil app for a certain portion of the sponsorship amount. Indradhanu took up this issue, and eventually, on the 22nd of April, it raised a complaint with the Initiative for Gender Equity and Sensitisation (IGES) IIT Delhi. While the document itself has remained elusive, the clause has been confirmed by some members of the RDV team to BSP on the condition of anonymity - the majority of the amount linked to the deal, they told BSP, was to be given unconditionally before the event, while a certain percentage was promised against female profiles.
On receiving a tepid response from IGES, who claimed to have no authority in the case, members of Indradhanu approached professors from the Humanities and Social Sciences department as a last resort. It was finally then that the situation was brought to the notice of the President of BRCA. "The BRCA President is officially supposed to sign off on all MoUs. So one morning, a stack of MoUs was sent to them, and they gave the go ahead for all, including the Dil Mil one," stated a coordinator.
Soon the student body received a mail from Prof. Sandeep Jha, the President of the Board for Recreational and Cultural Activities (BRCA), taking note of the complaints raised, dispelling some of the rumours and misinformation being spread and promising prompt action. ‚ÄúWe are heading to SAC to meet the RDV team to listen to their side of the story.‚Äù, the email said.
The entire fiasco culminated in yet another mail from the BRCA president that announced the termination of Dil Mil as a sponsor and the cancellation of its exclusive event, Speed Dating. The official reason cited was students being underage, even though the registration forms for the event asked for proof of age. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take a decision on ‚ÄòPromnite‚Äô soon after studying its legalities,‚Äù the email said, and a few days later, Dil Mil‚Äôs second exclusive event was also cancelled, though partially, if not entirely, because of COVID guidelines. The criterion mandating Dil Mil downloads was removed from all external and internal forms, and students were advised to delete their profiles from the app. However, the complaints about VIP Pronite passes were revealed to be a misunderstanding. ‚ÄúThe VIP passes were not Pronite passes; rather they were the premium passes of the Dil Mil app being offered for free as an incentive to download the app,‚Äù the core team underlined.
‚ÄúNeither Indradhanu, nor IGES, were made privy to the discussions in the meeting,‚Äù the IGES as well as a few members of Indradhanu clarified.
Geeta Thatra, a senior consultant at Initiative for Gender Equity and Sensitisation (IGES), told BSP that IGES and Indradhanu kept pressurising the president to look into the matter of getting the data of the students deleted from the backend, as simple deletion of a profile didn‚Äôt ensure that all the data that had been uploaded to the application at the time of making the profile was completely removed from the servers of the application. ‚ÄúWe were promised by the administration and the team that they would look into this matter to get it resolved,‚Äù she said.
While Dil Mil was brought into the spotlight because of its unseemly commodification of women, the past few months have seen multiple instances of students being forced to download applications such as Probo or Yelow to attend certain events. Phishing emails have been circulated that claimed to sell NFT pronite passes on the Binance app and demanded PAN card details to confirm the bookings. Such instances elicited further clarifications from the BRCA President invalidating such requirements and became a recurring point of conflict between the attendees and organisers.
The Inside Scoop
In order to understand what really happened within the team when they started receiving complaints and objections, and find out more about the concerned sponsorship agreement, we approached multiple CTMs to ask them about their side of the story.
We inquired about the complaints that the BRCA President, Prof. Sandeep Jha, received and what the administration told the team. One of the CTMs said, ‚ÄúOn 22nd April around 7 or 8 pm, we received messages from Prof. Jha calling a meeting about Dil Mil‚Äôs sponsorship. In the meeting, he said that he had received some complaints from faculty members and students. One of the complaints was about the restriction that only girls could fill the form for Prom Night. We explained that it was done to avoid unruly incidents of catfishing that had occurred in previous editions of the fest. However, the team proactively resolved this and edited the poster and form to make the event inclusive of people of diverse sexual orientations. He was convinced by our arguments.‚Äù
On being asked about the data privacy concerns in apps like Yelow, we were assured by the RDV team that data privacy would be maintained. No further elaboration was given.
The CTMs also told us that downloading the apps was voluntary, and no one was forced to do so. ‚ÄúIf such an incident occurred, then we condemn it. However, we do not think it is wrong to ask someone to download an app voluntarily.‚Äù One CTM highlighted that even though the team had cleared all the miscommunication and misunderstanding regarding the VIP passes and entry to Prom, the administration still ordered them to cut ties with Dil Mil and also cancelled the two events without communicating the reasons behind the move.
Regarding the branding of Dil Mil seen during Pronites even after it was dropped as a sponsor, the CTM clarified that since all of the posters and banners had already been printed much earlier, the branding of Dil Mil was already there on them. Moreover, the CTM claimed that even the team was unaware of what the administration had conveyed to Dil Mil since they had directly connected Dil Mil to the admin.
Through all this discussion, the dissatisfaction of the organising team also became apparent. One CTM expressed displeasure that the administration sent an email to the student body without discussing it with the Rendezvous team. ‚ÄúThat email painted us in a bad light. Not everyone was involved or even aware about the deal made with Dil Mil, and calling out the entire team for women's exploitation was unjustified.‚Äù
On the matter of forcing students to download apps to attend events, the core team explained, "The number of new registrations is an absolute number generally offered as a deliverable. This is something that we can deliver before the fest. It ensures that some of the sponsorship amount reaches us earlier since many of the fest payments must be made before the events. In 2019, this app was TikTok, and since we couldn‚Äôt complete the deliverables, we made people download the app at the Pronite gates.‚Äù
However, the team members refused to comment on many of our questions. For instance, when directly asked about the MoU signed with Dil Mil, the CTMs declined to answer. We were also not offered any clarity on the meeting where the female representatives and activity heads were coerced to download Dil Mil.
The Underlying Concerns
BSP reached out to Hrithik Jain, a branding specialist and an alumnus of the Mudra Institute Of Communications, Ahmedabad, to gain insights into ethical marketing practices and whether the contracts with these companies were actually ethical or in good faith.
‚ÄúTo create an excellent, free-of-charge experience for the students in any fest, sponsors are brought in that provide funds in return for some deliverables. These deliverables are in terms of quantifiable potential growth of their brand, such as the total number of app downloads, registrations and active users, which can be quoted to investors or advertisers down the line. Thus, asking for app downloads in exchange for sponsorship money is a prevalent practice,‚Äù Jain stated.
He went on to explain that usually, downloading apps such as e-commerce platforms for a brief period is not that big a deal, even if people don‚Äôt directly relate to it. However, there is a level of potential discomfort attached to dating apps like Dil Mil that deal with interpersonal relationships, which might make people feel like their privacy is being violated. This also holds for Probo, which is not available on the Playstore, giving the impression of some sort of a risk associated with it, or Yelow, where personal data is being collected in the form of Aadhar card and Pan card details.
However, Jain was of the opinion that, in the latter case, the concerns about data exploitation were not very well-founded. ‚ÄúWhenever users give their details to an app, the onus lies on them to keep that data secure, the specificities of which are in their privacy policy. If an application does not have a privacy policy, one essentially and unknowingly ends up consenting to share one‚Äôs data without any defined consequences of how it is going to be used,‚Äù he explained. However, he reasoned that any start-up that is genuinely trying to grow and build a large base of loyal, active users will always have its privacy policy well mapped out in an effort to gain their trust. Thus, it is highly improbable that they would violate their users' privacy and exploit their data.
‚ÄúThe sponsors failed to foresee how the student community would receive their apps. In the case of all three of these apps, forcing downloads from people who didn‚Äôt believe in the concept would lead to discomfort and resentment, as explained earlier. This was not the best marketing initiative on their end, and even students organising the fest should‚Äôve predicted this and never agreed to such absurd demands in the first place. The onus lies on both sides in this case,‚Äù Jain noted.
‚ÄúThere was an evident lack of gender sensitivity among the students involved in this process. Probably, if we had a significant number of females in positions of power in the team, this agreement with the dating application would have been invalidated or at least the problem would have been identified much prior to the conduction of the event. We introduce this concept of critical mass here, which talks about how in order to sensitise a large mass about a particular case of discrimination against a group, we require a significantly proportional number of representatives who can sympathise with or are part of the group being discriminated against. This will increase the number of voices wanting to highlight the problem in the community and make it more prominent to the public,‚Äù Thatra said on the possible causal inferences of the entire situation.

Harsh Realities: The Travails Of The LGBTQIA+ Community At IIT Delhi
BSP
Apr 30, 2022
6 min read
Updated:
May 1, 2022
"One of my scariest and humiliating moments was when I finally opened up to two of my close friends on campus. I told both of them separately of me being gay and they both had the same reaction;
Tu jhooth bol raha h na
(You are lying, right?) and
clearing out right now that I'm not interested in you
."
The IIT Delhi campus, for many of us, is a home away from home. And home is there to make us feel safe- to be a place where we can freely express our identities, voice our beliefs and explore our horizons without fear. Sometimes to get here, we need to ask ourselves many hard questions. We need to see if the campus is truly a safe space for all of us, and if it isn't, then how can we go about changing it? Asking such questions is not just acknowledging that we are responsible for the bad on the campus, but also realizing that we can contribute and be responsible for the good in it. This motivation led to the conception of an article on the lives of students on the campus belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community. This article takes a deep dive into the lives of these students, raising important questions of inclusivity, empathy, and ultimately acceptance as we seek to understand what has to be done to make things better than they are.
We conducted a survey to gauge the inclusivity amongst IIT Delhi students and understand the scale of awareness. Out of the 306 responses we received, 12.4% of them identify with the LGBTQIA+ community. When asked how inclusive the campus is on a scale of 1 to 5, 34% responded with a 3/5 and 23.7% with a 2/5. The people who do not identify with the community possess a similar view of the prevailing conditions.
At this juncture, it is important for us to clarify that the form circulated can in no way be treated as a complete and accurate collector of issues since some questions can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore, statistics have been presented in this report only if they were significant and within the intervals of confidence. For further information regarding gender and sexual identities, kindly go through this
appendix
.
The Reception of Non-Binary
‚ÄúPeople just need to normalize being queer. I don't want special treatment. I wanna be normal‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen I came out, people around me, specifically in the boys' hostel, got awkward."
‚ÄúThe amount of casual jokes about the community is something that puts me off all the time. I think masking behind all this is homophobia and to a large extent ignorance which is quite sad‚Äù.
From the people of the LGBTQIA+ community who responded to our survey, 13% have come out publicly, while 63% have come out to their close friends. 13% haven't come out to anyone yet.
47% of the respondents who identify with the community believed that casual homophobic jokes are "widespread". 78% of the respondents who don't identify voted that they are at most "moderately frequent", if not rare. The difference in opinions hints at how the lens of the people are tainted by where they stand in the spectrum and the experiences they have on an everyday basis.
60% of the respondents identifying with the community believe that the campus is mostly accepting and there is no expression of hatred or aversion from the LGBTQIA+ community.
When going through the comments and suggestions in the survey, we came across a variety of reactions. From people opening up to sharing homophobic incidents they have faced, like being harassed by both students and staff for painting nails, or casual jokes to people mocking the use of pronouns and resorting to the popular transphobic meme of "attack/helicopter".
On a more positive note, a few of our respondents had welcoming experiences when they came out to their peers.
‚ÄùHonestly, it was a bit relieving to tell someone and it turned out great. Like they were all very cool with it. And the best part of it was like some of them who I came out to became much more vocal about supporting queer people and becoming allies‚Äù
‚ÄúThe first person I came out to in college was my best friend and their reaction was also very heartwarming. They were asking questions- not at me, but for me. They were inquisitive, trying to understand me. I think that‚Äôs the best thing any person can do if they want to be an ally- asking questions to learn.‚Äù
We took in suggestions from our respondents on what could be done to alleviate the situation and make the campus a more inclusive space. We received some interesting ideas for the same.
‚ÄúStatus quo dictates hostels as boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô hostels, leaving no space for queer people to choose properly. Having gender-neutral hostels would hence be a step forward. This step has been potentially discussed for the newly constructed Saptagiri hostel as well. While it might be just rumoured at the moment, it will surely make the campus more inclusive.‚Äù
People from the queer community and otherwise believed that having compulsory courses relating to gender studies were required on campus.
‚ÄúThere still exists a deafening silence about specific topics‚Äù
To further our understanding of LGBTQIA+ inclusivity, we contacted a couple of professors at IIT Delhi to share their opinions and ideas and what measures the administration and the student community can take to improve inclusivity.
We interviewed Professor Arudra Burra, an assistant professor at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences. Prof. Burra teaches moral, political, and legal philosophies and is also the faculty advisor of Indradhanu, a student-run LGBTQIA+ collective of IIT Delhi.
When asked about his opinion on what inclusivity at campus corresponds to, Prof. Burra said he thinks of inclusivity as having three components in general. "One would be that there is no discrimination, where no individual is penalized for being themselves and embracing their identity. The next level would be where we have free spaces to display your identity without any fear or worry of being judged, a space where you can be comfortable in your skin and embrace your individuality. The third would be one more step ahead of where everyone celebrates their identity and respects each other for their identity," he noted.
Professor Tobias Toll, an assistant professor at the Engineering Physics department and a proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community, admits never facing discrimination at IIT Delhi.
Though he believes that it is important to promote LGBTQIA+ awareness and thinks that "it is important to listen to those at IITD (faculty, staff, students, and others) who identify as LGBTQIA+ when developing and expanding the scope of institutional boards for different kinds of complaint redressals, as well as affirmative actions. Being LGBTQIA + friendly is not only about redressals but also about actively building an inclusive environment that is open to all identities and backgrounds at IITD on an everyday basis. For this, their voices have to be heard."
Prof. Burra agreed that though there is no upfront discrimination based on sexual identities, there still exists a deafening silence about specific topics. He also believes that IIT Delhi may be a lot different from other IITs but is also more conservative. "People have different levels of exposure, it is not that they are always supporting discrimination or are homophobic, but it might be because they are not aware of these issues and someone has confronted them for the very first time," Prof. Burra remarked on the possible reasons behind the uncomfortable silence.
Finally, when asked about what measures should be taken to improve inclusivity, Prof. Toll thinks that we can expand the currently available gender sensitization training for professors to LGBTQIA+ issues and homophobia as well.
The widening ambit of Indradhanu
Over the years, Indradhanu, a student-run LGBTQIA + collective of IIT Delhi set up on 23rd January 2013 with an aim to create a safe space for everyone, has taken various initiatives to spread awareness in and around campus. The group orchestrated a pride parade at the institute in 2019 and actively conducted orientations for freshers as a part of the Tour of Stalls. Indradhanu also maintains an active social media presence in their efforts to create a safer and more open space.
The Student Affairs Council recognized Indradhanu as an official student body in IIT Delhi on 27th December 2021. Indhradhanu is currently trying to understand how inclusive the campus is by hosting workshops, panel discussions, and events in order to raise awareness about the issue of gender sensitivity and inclusion. They had conducted a recruitment drive in January and plan to aid the administration in making the campus a safer and more inclusive space.
IIT Delhi also witnessed the establishment of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, becoming the pioneering institution in the country to do so. Officially active since 16th January 2022, ODI aims to celebrate diversity on campus and create a more inclusive environment. According to a post released by Prof. Rao, the Director of IITD at the time, the broad mandate of the office will be working towards gender, sexuality, caste, language, disability, and mental health to foster greater inclusion.

An eye over the I-Grade
BSP
Apr 18, 2022
4 min read
‚ÄúYaar medical mil gaya! Abb hostel jaakar araam se sounga," said a student outside the hospital with a newfound hope of an innocent child in their eyes. In the past one week, many students could be seen lining outside the doctor's door with the most trivial excuses, hoping to secure a medical which they could put in their I-grade application. The I grade policy was introduced to give students a fair chance of evaluation in case of a medical emergency. However, this isn't the first time our college has witnessed a sudden increase in the number of people getting ill during the majors' season and taking an I grade in certain courses. Last semester, when it was announced that the majors will be held in an offline mode for the onboarded students, whispers could be heard throughout the crowded library about taking an I grade and hoping for an online remajor. As fate would have it, the remajors had to be conducted online due to the unexpected third wave of Covid-19. The most obvious question to ask would be, Are all these cases genuine? Does this happen every year, or is this a new post-Covid phenomenon? To dig deeper into this issue, BSP reached out to the doctors, the staff of the IIT Delhi hospital as well as the students seeking an I grade.
"It is almost funny how they act all sick while making their entry and feel all good again until they reach the doctor's room, and then the drama starts again", responded the receptionist at the hospital when asked if she feels these cases are genuine. On the evening of 12th April, the last day of applying for an I grade, 404 people checked in at the hospital, with nearly 250 of them being UG students. While it is possible that a proportion of them were genuine cases, it seemed apparent to the staff and the doctors that most students were there to get a signed excuse to "bunk their exams." The records at the reception suggest that the distribution of the students reaching out to the hospital from the different years is more or less uniform, with the newer batches appearing slightly more than the previous ones. After a brief analysis of the queue standing outside room no. 5 and 8 and spotting their batchmates, our reporters concluded that many students showed up after skipping their exams that very morning.
What is the illness that a large group of UG students seemingly acquired?
When we asked the doctors, we got a list of the four most frequently cited diseases by the students to get a medical certificate in the past week - fever, stomachache, headache, and nausea. For a reason unknown, "loose motion" was at the top of the list, with almost every student coming to the hospital suffering from it. The doctor found it particularly annoying how generic and non-specific the students were about their ailments - with failing to provide any details about their "fever" or "pain" when asked more about it.
When asked, if these cases aren‚Äôt genuine, why the hospital provided the fake medical certificates, the doctors expressed their annoyance and helplessness at the whole situation. They tried to point out to many students that they are healthy and do not need any medication but only to be rudely shouted back at. In some cases, the students even threatened the doctor saying, "It would be your fault if we fail our exams. Just give us any sort of prescription." Overall, the doctors described the experience as exhausting and 'nothing short of a torture.' The staff at the hospital described that they have to go through the same ordeal every exam season. However, they also maintained that the size of the student crowd was significantly larger this year than the ones during the pre-covid times, estimating it to be around 40% more.
To understand the reason behind taking an I grade by faking an illness, we talked to a few students standing in the queue outside the doctor's office. For most students we spoke to, it simply seemed like a matter of being underprepared for the exams or a strategy to reduce their workload by taking an I grade for a couple of majors. Courses like MTL106 and SBL100 also saw many people applying for I grade. At the same time, professors from the Textile department said they had been conducting the major exam for the last 30 years but had never seen such mass absenteeism.
The situation isn't just about academic laxity. It compromises the treatment of genuine cases by increasing the hospital's waiting time and crowd. The staff reported arguing with students over not wearing masks even after being informed about the two potential Covid cases at the hospital. The crowding by the students also created issues for the employees and older people visiting the hospital, who decided it is better to leave considering the waiting time caused by the crowd. The increase in the crowd was so evident that the faculty visiting the hospital for their check-ups were very curious and concerned about the sudden spike. Some students had reportedly overeaten intentionally one day before their majors in order to get an upset stomach which would get them an I grade.
Exams were always a part of our lives. However, stories of mass cheating and unethical means to avoid evaluation have grown exponentially since the pandemic struck. While students do want offline classes like the "Pre-Covid" era, they do not wish assessments from the same. It seems as though students have grown too comfortable with the new normal. What remains to be seen is whether the students would continue finding ways to hold the status quo or accept the new-old normal.

Supernumerary at work: The story of the improving ratio
Raunaq Saraswat and Ishita Hans
Feb 15, 2021
21 min read
What, why and how?
The problem at hand was simple - there aren‚Äôt enough women in the IITs. There wasn‚Äôt even a large enough population of women
attempting
to get into the IITs. This was (obviously) no reflection on calibre, or anything of the sort - the median CGPA of girls in IITD was nearly 1 point higher than the median for boys, as of 2012. Yet, numbers dwindled, and the IITs had to act, an 8% representation of women was simply unacceptable.
Thus came the ‚Äúcure‚Äù (borrowing the parlance of the hour) - supernumerary seats for women. It was a way to counterbalance the multitude of barriers that stand in the way of the average woman compared to the average man. To that effect, the expectations set on this cure, to be fair, were high. From the ground up, it was an attempt to create a positive cycle whereby the social barriers that exist could be broken.
First, the aim was to increase the number of women taking admission into IITs once they had cleared JEE Advanced. In the past, 12% percent of the 20% of women that cleared the JEE Advanced would not take advantage of the opportunity at hand, due to various hidden social pressures. The introduction of this quota meant to break that cycle, to improve the number of women actually joining IITs. Long term, the goal was to break the social stigmas that exist around women in traditionally male dominated branches like Mechanical Engineering, or Civil Engineering.
Second, the aim was to improve the number of women attempting the exam in the first place. The hidden shackles of social pressure, the issues faced at coaching, could perhaps be influenced by this incentive (going to an IIT) that the scheme creates. Long term, by creating more role models in the field, it meant to create a culture that could promote inculcation of young women.
Lastly, it meant to create a better, more open environment in the colleges themselves. With more peer interaction for women, and the benefit of more perspective into the problems that exist, the IITs could create social change through technology better. Every girl that entered the college would be able to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù and find a peer group with similar tastes more easily. Of course, more open cross gender interaction wouldn‚Äôt hurt either. Sexism, in both a professional and non-professional setting, continues to be a real problem, and this attempts to do its part in solving that by enforcing more interaction at younger ages.
Of course, as with any cure, this one came with its set of side effects. The primary one in this case was that of uproar from male candidates, who felt they were somehow losing their seats to undeserving candidates with lesser ranks. While the semantics of how the scheme works lends itself to such a debate, it is not one we should necessarily get sucked into. The reality is, this point of view exists, and its existence means a certain regret and hostility toward the women availing this scheme exists too. It is the effect of this hostility that should concern us.
With 2020 being the third year of the supernumerary scheme, we attempt to assess how the increment in the influx of women in IIT‚Äôs has affected the scene at different steps: from coaching, to admission, to life at IIT, including relationships with professors, TAs, lab assistants, and peers. We juxtapose that with the stigma supernumerary is often accompanied by, and understand how well the scheme has achieved (or begun to achieve) its (rather lofty) goals.
Before the hallows of IIT
The two or more years leading up to JEE are arguably one of the most intense times in an IITian‚Äôs life. These years, requiring consistent focus and hard work, are also shaped by an aspirants‚Äô peer group, their exposure to the right guidance and study material, and a supportive environment, among other things. One of the objectives of supernumerary seats was to increase the number of women appearing in JEE Advanced and consequently opting for IIT post-qualifying, something that is sensitive to creation of role-models, the stigma around specific disciplines and engineering in general, and whether or not parents invest in the future of girls as an engineer.
‚ÄúYes, indeed, people feel inspired once they see someone achieving their goals, they feel "yeah, it is possible‚Ä¶.If they can do it, then why can‚Äôt we"
. -
Aishvi, 2015 Entry
‚ÄúI was aware of the lack of women at IIT because it was evident in my coaching institute as well. However, that did not discourage me personally because I knew of a couple of other women that had made it to IIT.‚Äù - Kritika, 2016 Entry
Role model creation was agreed upon by most to be an essential phenomenon in encouraging women and their parents to pursue IIT‚Äôs dream. However, the extent to which this has happened, specifically for women, recently remains a point of contention.
‚ÄúIf I have to talk about my hometown, after my selection, many people contacted my parents and sent their children to coaching institutes and after that many success stories...so, yes, it‚Äôs improving every day, and I am hoping it will improve further. But it‚Äôs mostly boys and their parents who contacted us. The number of girls has increased from zero to a positive integer‚Ä¶.So eventually I feel it will grow‚Äù - Aishvi, 2015 Entry
‚ÄúI have seen the effect of the creation of role-models only through relatives and friends. My Chachu enrolled my cousin sister in the coaching institute because I too had joined one in 9th. So, in that sense, the effect can be seen. And this extends to males as well, not just females.‚Äù - Jasleen, 2016 Entry
While most agree that there has been a positive shift due to the increased number of women at IIT, they believe that there are still ways to go and more concrete effects can only be seen a few years further down the line.
‚ÄúI feel that the number of girls attending IIT coaching centers in my hometown has increased. My sister is 6 years younger than me and went to the same coaching as I did. I remember being pleasantly surprised to see a significantly higher proportion of girls. The creation of role-models is a long-term goal. While we have made good progress, I think we have a long way to go, as it is not only about role-models at school or university level but also in careers across a diverse range of sectors. These are systemic changes and will happen over a period of time and I feel we are taking steps in the right direction.‚Äù - Aditi, 2015 Entry
Connotations about individual branches being less suitable for women permeating in the mentality of coaching institutes and families has come across as a recurring theme. This sentiment is shown by parents, family members, and, at times, coaching institutes and teachers. An argument can be made that the stigma around specific branches and IIT inhibit women from enrolling in IIT over other colleges post qualifying JEE. It can also potentially harm these disciplines by making it harder for qualified female engineers to opt for them.
‚ÄúDuring our counselling, our teachers were like branches like mechanical are not suitable for girls.‚Äù - Vanshika*, 2017 Entry
‚Äú...this mentality persists everywhere that how girls would take up mech and civil. As such there was no issue regarding accepting seats, parents/ relatives at times think that it would be tough with no or very few girls in the dept and doing all that MCP labs wale kaam. In our senior batch, there was only 1 girl initially in mech dept, so that makes girls a bit hesitant at the beginning..‚Äù - Ankita, 2017 Entry
Many believe that these norms are sensitive to role-model creation and, therefore, can improve with supernumerary.
‚ÄúLuckily for me, my parents were fine with it. In fact, my mother is a mechanical eng herself.
But yes, my relatives were trying to push me towards the medical field because apparently, it suited me more and I ended up taking math along with biology in 11th.‚Äù - Anushka*, 2017 Entry
‚ÄúDuring my counselling I choose chemical over mechanical. And this was advised by my father and sisters even though they are also IITians. This was mainly because future prospects in core mechanical is sort of industry based, sometimes on remote locations. This year one girl contacted me and was confused about choosing mechanical because of the same reasons. But after talking to 2-3 girls from mechanical she felt more comfortable and finally took mechanical in IITD. So, yes, more role models are encouraging more girls to take up mechanical - Divyanshi, 2018 Entry
‚Äú...I guess it would help if we had more women in unconventional branches and so it seems like these branches are doable because as a 17-year-old you‚Äôre impressionable and end up thinking that you should not take that risk when someone is telling you that it won‚Äôt work out.‚Äù - Anuja, 2016 Entry
Societal pressure against engineering for women, parents preferring institutes closer to home, and not co-ed ones were also highlighted.
‚ÄúIn my coaching, in Meerut, in the non medical batch, there were 2 girls out of a 100-150, and in the medical it was more like 4-5, out of 50. I‚Äôd say this was largely because of gender roles in the town, where women were conditioned to want careers that won‚Äôt build familial pressure, or stay within the town. Other times it was just the attitude of vaise bhi shaadi karni hai. This came from both family, and the girl herself.‚Äú - Poorva, 2017 Entry
‚Äú...parents didn't care enough for girls to get an engineering degree. Most of my friends were dependant on an option of going to some DU college ..as it is considered most convenient for girls at my place...maybe that could be one of the reasons why girls didn't give much importance to JEE‚Äù - Savi, 2017 Entry
‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed that girls that were living in Delhi, took up IITD even if it was biotech or textile specifically to be closer to home and so that hometown phenomena that your house is close by and put it above your branch preference are there.‚Äù - Anuja, 2016 Entry
Many agree that an increase can help these women opt for IIT, which has occurred through supernumerary, causing a change in the general societal attitude as well as there now being a better chance of women qualifying.
‚ÄúThere aren't many girls getting into eng colleges because there aren't many opting for math after 10th, and even if they do, not all get the right coaching because maybe they don't have a good coaching institute in their area, and they have to travel to another city.
Whatever may be the reason, without family support, getting the right resources to crack the exam is tough. With more girls in IIT, it helps with the change in the attitude of society in general, so more girls would be encouraged to take up maths in 11th‚Äù- Anushka*, 2017 Entry
‚ÄúI agree with parents letting girls go to coaching classes more or even letting them take a drop year, which is very uncommon for girls because now they have a stronger chance.‚Äù - Anukriti, 2016 Entry
Another important aspect of JEE is the life inside coaching institutes - the place where most end up spending hours each day. There is a general trend wherein female students feel much comfortable interacting with other female students and the dearth of women in the senior batches or coaching institutes, in general, has a detrimental effect on the preparation and the peer interactions of female aspirants.
The peer interactions came out to be an important aspect that suffered due to the lack of female students. The effect of these came through as pronounced in not just the personal day-to-day life but also the academic life.
‚ÄúI used to tell my teachers that I do not want to stay in alpha because there weren‚Äôt any girls and I didn‚Äôt have any friends. And the second batch, beta, had a lot of girls and so I started taking classes in beta. My family and teachers told me to go back to the alpha because I had worked very hard to get there but I was not comfortable.‚Äù - Ananya*, 2015 Entry
‚ÄúIt also had a negative effect on my confidence in some ways, not seeing enough women in the institutes.‚Äù - Kritika, 2016 Entry
‚ÄúAnd when you have doubts, you wouldn‚Äôt always go to the teachers you‚Äôd try and resolve it in your peer groups and since I was more comfortable with girls and there weren‚Äôt as many girls it came to a point where I started taking additional coaching in Kurukshetra to resolve those doubts, I later dropped it because it got too hectic. But it later got better as I made more friends in those two years. ‚Äú - Ananya*, 2015 Entry
According to the interviewees, the years post supernumerary saw an increase in the number of women going to coaching. However, the sentiment of little peer interaction and its consequences remained largely ubiquitous, a possible reason for the same being that there still were fewer female students in the top batches or those who were as invested in JEE preparation as their other male peers.
‚ÄúOne of disadvantage that I felt during my coaching was that since there were a small number of girls so my discussion group was limited, at that time I was not very comfortable in asking boys doubt and stuff‚Äù - Divyanshi, 2018 Entry
‚Äú...there were very few girls who were seriously competitive about the exam and were prepping to the same extent as me so I did face limitations in terms of having an extensive study group, guys usually cluster together and we feel some amount of inertia breaking into that group...‚Äù - Urvashi, 2017 Entry
‚ÄúThere were only 3 girls who used to be in the top 50 in the entire Fiitjee center. So because of that, it was difficult to have a circle with girls as your friends. Boys would sit and do things together all the time which didn't affect the academics but the bonding.‚Äù - Ayushi, 2018 Entry
A common theme of safety issues behind girls traveling to and fro from coaching was observed. This was present in both the post and pre supernumerary years, however, the increase in the number of women traveling seems to have made the situation better.
‚ÄúI am from Rohtak and went to coaching in Delhi, Pitampura. There were security issues in traveling but my family managed. However, there were just 2 girls in a batch of 60 and there were no other girls from Rohtak at the time and this could be one of the reasons that they stayed behind and attended the local prep classes. ‚Äù - Kritika, 2016 Entry
‚Äú...the teacher would get surrounded by a herd of guys, asking doubts after the class and that used to stretch for long and when that got over, it would be too late.
Also, several times, classes used to end late, which again led to those issues. I even wished I was a guy then..‚Äù - Ankita, 2017 Entry
Many interviewees also reported a general attitude of condescension and patronization from the coaching teachers. This attitude can play a part in reinforcing the stigma around women in STEM and could have a further detrimental effect on female aspirants‚Äô confidence. This, too, was observed to have been predominant in both the years pre and post supernumerary.
‚ÄúI noticed a bit of a condescending attitude with me. They would break down things for everybody but it seemed like they were trying a little harder with me and that sort of came to notice.‚Äù - Anuja, 2016 Entry
‚ÄúOne of the teachers asked us regularly if we understood the topic, I think in their mind they were just trying to ensure that we were doing okay in the topic and weren't lagging behind. But the specific need to ensure we (girls) weren't lagging behind and asking it specifically to girls in a class with students who all kind of had a similar performance didn't feel okay to me. So technically it wasn't a problem for any of us but it was an experience.‚Äù - Shivani*, 2017 Entry
At the hostel corridor
"I have always envied the prolific junior-senior interaction prevalent in boy's hostels,"
a feeling which resonated in most of the conversations we had with the female students. Hostel culture here simply refers to the atmosphere inside the hostels. It's been observed that there is a stark difference between the hostel cultures within boys and girls hostels. Poltu/election equations concerning institute PORs are also affected by the constricted interactions inside girl's hostels. Krishna, BSA DGsec 2019, recalled that there was very little enthusiasm from her hostel when she was competing for the post and hence only a few rounds of discussion in the hostel rooms regarding the same. While you would often find a junior laying loose in his seniors' room in a boy's hostel, it is a rare occurrence at the girls‚Äô hostel. The mess environment is much friendlier and noisier, and so are the hostel events at the eleven boy's hostel, while the two girls' hostels are relatively insipid on the same fronts.
‚Äú...for some reason, the boys seem closer to their respective seniors, who are more in number, than girls. Maybe more women could help with that. But in general, limited interaction does have a negative effect because you understand IIT mostly by advice from seniors.‚Äù - Kritika, 2016 Entry
‚Äú...and then there is a difference between the hostel cultures of boys and girls. For example, in boys hostel seniors call the juniors in their room and they used to talk all night long or like they just meet in the mess and start a conversation but here we don't have anything as such. Seniors mostly keep to themselves hence the junior senior bonding is very low and in my opinion it's kind of an important aspect of college which we are missing.‚Äù - Ayushi, 2018 Entry
Having a business-like relation with the hostel seniors is a common complaint by many female students, but none could directly relate it to the fewer number of girls as compared to boys. To an extent, it does play a role but it cannot be, at the same time, considered as the sole reason as even the female students from the 2018 entry batch, with supernumerary seats, have observed similar limitations in the interaction with their seniors as well as the junior batches.
‚Äú...there is very little hostel bonding culture both within a year and across years and I do feel it's helpful but absent in girls hostels. I am not sure if it's because there are a lesser number of girls. It could be since most girls then end up forming stronger peer groups with guys given their abundance‚Äù - Urvashi, 2017 Entry
Hostel culture and junior-senior interaction not only play a significant role in the academic side but also dictates/reflects the representation at BSA and several clubs, both BRCA and CAIC. Various female students from 2015 to 2018 batches feel that lesser interaction and bonding with hostel seniors is one reason for the lesser representation of girls in these clubs.
‚Äú...how much encouragement freshers get from hostel seniors for joining a certain club also influences their decision. I didn‚Äôt know about the Aeromodelling club until my third year, because of course there were very few seniors in my hostel who were a part of that club.‚Äù - Aditi, 2015 Entry
Positively, supernumerary seats have brought about an impact in this arena. With an increasing number of girls, a greater and a more wide spread representation has been observed amongst various clubs.
‚Äú‚Ä¶for aeroclub the overall participation has increased a lot and I was involved as a fresher and also in the recruitment process of the incoming juniors earlier this year. I did not see any sort of discrimination towards either gender‚Äù - Muskaan, 2018 Entry
‚Äú...I've been involved in dramatics and have noticed an increase in the number of girls in institute teams. One of the reason is that more seniors lead to a better participation from the hostel and hence more girls are encouraged to get involved further‚Äù - Divyanshi, 2018 Entry
‚Äú...when I had joined there were barely any girls in the coding clubs or other clubs and now I think that general culture is coming more into girls‚Äô hostels‚Äù - Anuja, 2016 Entry
‚Äú...representation of girls in Music Club significantly improved in my second year, when the 2019 batch joined the clubs. Since there are more girls now the probability of finding interested people has automatically increased and hence it‚Äôs just easier taking part in an activity when you know there is at least one more girl with you.‚Äù - Naveli, 2018 Entry
As far as BSA is concerned, only a feeble zealousness or "hostel spirit" is observed during competitions, especially during GC, as only two hostels compete with each other, assuring a podium finish in any case. Whereas in boy's hostels, GC is one of the most awaited and highly celebrated events and is largely responsible for cross-year and intra-year bonding, at least in the initial years of your stay at IITD. While the supernumerary policy has led to an overall increase in the representation of female students in most clubs, its effect is yet to be seen in the domain of sports and the inner ecosystem of female hostels.
Peering at thy peers
A description of peer groups is in place because this term will be used wantonly. Peer groups mean, according to Wikipedia, "people of similar economic and social stature. The members of this group are likely to influence the person's beliefs and behavior." We will be referring to a broader definition of a peer group along the lines of a support system, "friends" namely.
To set up the canvas before we start painting the picture of peer groups at IITD, it is of foremost importance to understand that peer groups are formed in spaces of mutual respect and belonging. STEM or to take a further step, IITs, on the whole, have historically witnessed a dismal female to male ratio, propounding its own set of problems.
‚ÄúHonestly, I was unaware of the skewed gender ratio. We do not see that in schools, and how gender issues can affect us personally is opaque, at least it was to me as a child. IIT was just another exam away, and that was the target.‚Äù
-
Arundhati, 2015 Entry
The cruciality of a congenial peer-group is apparent in everyday actions, in the aid you provide each other in assignments, in the preparation for quizzes, minors & majors, and in the many facets of your life that demand sharing, and by extension, a caring and supportive environment. The abysmal count of female undergraduates in the institute, in the years preceding Supernumerary, and the casually sexist attitudes of the male populace at IITD, are two prominently recurring themes in our respondents‚Äô tryst with their peers.
‚ÄúI was the only girl in mechanical. With boys having friends from among hostels, alienation is imminent, to begin with. I ended up making amazing friends, but that does not mean I would not have benifitted from at least one more person studying the same subjects or working on assignments same as mine in the hostel.‚Äù - Arundhati, 2015 Entry
"The reality is that girls have to deal with very small peer groups, and it was a problem in the past for me, which is why I think it's good to get more girls in. When I was in EE, I had all three peers in my hostel. Once I changed to CS, there were none. I had to go to Bharti Building or further for any semblance of help." - Poorva, 2016 Entry
"Ya, so like when ever we went to the workshop for our work, the staff would be quite happy to see that girls are also doing these kinds of works. But, like the seniors quite more insinuated that girls don't do this, you may not be able to do, so let boys do this. It was quite difficult for me to adjust with the seniors already in there, they had a different mindset kind of. Also, the environment was not much comfortable due to which I left the club.‚Äù - Rupanjali*, 2018 Entry
"QC and Lit on the other hand had major problems. The general aura was the girls aren‚Äôt great at either of the two, the representation was very skewed and I had often noticed women being talked over by guys in QC and Lit events." - Ragini* , 2015 Entry
"Yes! I know very few men from my batch who would not crib about girls having easier in placements, and that for me is the starting point of the roadblock in finding like-minded peers" - Samriddhi, 2015 Entry
In the years supernumerary policy was not present, it seemed a boon to have students and seniors in your hostel from the same department. Supernumerary seats have, to say the least, increased the odds to find like-minded peers, both inside and outside of your hostel. A hostel study group means that you don't have to face assignments and "that one prof" alone. Help is just a room away. Before supernumerary seats were introduced, branches such as mechanical, civil, computer science had a dismal number of female students.
Hostels serve as the first point of contact for any fresher and are seen to facilitate the formation of peer groups through certain activities or events, and in the broader sense, through the trickling down of hostel culture, say the GC fervour in Jwala. Increasing the number of female students thus creates a higher likelihood of finding multiple students interested in a club, and for interest to convert into commitment a sense of belonging is needed. Hostel, undeniably, holds a large chunk of that.
"Number of girls simply...lesser the people, lesser are people with common interests". - Savi, 2017 Entry
"It's just easier taking part in an activity when you know there is at least one more girl with you." - Naveli, 2018 Entry
Changes accompanying supernumerary seats may not have been monumental, however, significant developments have taken place. All of the responses that pertained to the academic difficulties faced by departments with a low number of females came from the 16' 17' batches. These batches did not have any supernumerary seats, and as for the 18‚Äô batch when the policy came into being, none were recorded.
‚ÄúSeat Stealers‚Äù
While we, earlier in the article, discuss the potential positives of the scheme, and whether they worked, we haven‚Äôt considered the (very real) potential for negative consequences. We attempt to explore the possible harms the supernumerary scheme may have, and anecdotes of how they have manifested.
Perhaps the most classical - a standard problem seen in reservation. A sentiment is observed to exist - that one availing of the supernumerary scheme, has essentially nicked the seat off a more deserving candidate. Of course, as with any sentiment or narrative, people report it to varying degrees, ranging from not hearing of it, to having experienced it first hand.
‚ÄúGirls were blamed for stealing ranks‚Äù ~Priya*, 2018 Entry
‚ÄúPeople who I thought were my close friends regularly made comments about how dumb girls are.‚Äù ~ Maria, 2018 Entry
‚ÄúMore of it appears online certainly. But there is definitely a belief that it's easier if you're a girl and some people make comments on the same.‚Äù - Kaavya, 2017 Entry
‚ÄúNo, I haven't ever felt discriminated against directly. But I have seen comments related to that being made on social media by people I know.‚Äù ~ Muskaan, 2018 Entry
This sentiment largely extends itself to the academic performance of girls. While the scheme originally does set out to improve interaction, and thus decrease casual sexism, it is possible that the problem has gotten worse. It may be that given the higher median performance of girls, a culture of offhand remarks is created, one where girls are written off as getting higher marks - because they are girls.
"Girls go to profs and cry to get their marks increased." ~ Deepika*, 2015 Entry
This argument remains largely divided, with sets of people feeling that there was sometimes extra help provided to girls, especially in physically oriented labs like MCP101, while others felt that help was deserved, since they worked at it harder.
‚ÄúFor example while smoothing out the metal edges (in the MCP101 lab), they [TAs] used to come and assist girls more than guys because we didn't do it properly and lacked the physical strength. Similarly, while working in a group the heavy machinery part was done by the guys.‚Äù ~ Vanshika*, 2017 Entry
‚ÄúThere was a sense of unfair hostility, at least personally that I felt, which was a sentiment that TAs helped me more, or I got more marks. This was probably just because I was more eloquent with my doubts, and many other boys really weren't.‚Äù ~ Poorva, 2017 Entry
Perhaps a simple explanation to explaining the better performance of girls could be to realise that girls managing to occupy these seats are already part of a more high achieving bracket, simply because they have had to overcome the barriers society puts in place for them. The average girl, thus, has probably had to work harder, deal with more, for the same result - rank, marks, whatever it may be.
On the other hand, the existence of partiality is not an idea that can be dismissed offhand. An outcome of patriarchy, is sometimes a culture of patronizing women - helping them, because the belief is that they can‚Äôt help themselves. It is not unlikely that we may find a case like this, especially in fields that are not traditionally considered to be fit for girls - things like physical labour, or engineering.
However, regardless of the true reasons behind the existence of it, the presence of such a narrative does cause a problem. It could lead to very real effects, not dissimilar to how bullying does. Most commonly, the effect of this hostility is felt during intern and placement season, when some feel the toxicity hits a crescendo.
‚ÄúWith respect to to TnP, there is an attitude that it‚Äôs easier for girls (ironic since everyone said that during third year intern, and I didn‚Äôt get a TnP one), and I am thankful I got through TnP online, where I did not have to pay attention to the snide comments that get made. The supernumerary seats thing does contribute to that sort of hostility, I feel.‚Äù ~ Poorva, 2017 Entry
‚ÄúIt is inevitable, I suppose. Something similar happens during the intern/placement season, quite evident with all the memes circulating around.‚Äù ~ Rekha*, 2017 Entry (in response to being asked if an undeserving tag is levied on girls)
Some feel that it affects women earlier too, though, depriving them of confidence in the early days at IITD, a time when it is already hard to adjust.
‚ÄúIt was being aware of the fact that you came here through quota and not because of your potential. And it becomes intimidating at the start if you‚Äôre unable to cope up and one exam going wrong goes a long way. I used to spend a lot of time boosting the confidence of my female mentees but it was not easy for then. And that barrier between male and female has increased, I noticed in my 5th year. Because earlier, your male friends used to support you even if you did not do well but now I feel that the female students are afraid to ask for help because she does not have that confidence in her.‚Äù ~ Ananya*, 2015 Entry, on why students sometimes lacked confidence.
Given these effects, it would not be far fetched to conclude that a significant harm exists. The big question then, is this harm outweighing the benefits? Fairly unanswerable, since metrics of harm and benefit, especially for narratives, are very hard to devise. Just getting arguments for and against would be a challenge.
The question we can deal with though, is whether this narrative is merited. Can it be changed? Once again, opinions are divided. The way the scheme works, the word ‚Äúsupernumerary‚Äù, means that seats for girls are an add-on. They are not in replacement for any general category seat, meaning nobody actually loses the seat that girls take. If there are more than 20 percent girls, they‚Äôre there because they were higher on the rank list. Why should girls have the extra seats, the advantage, the quota though? The explanation is simple, it‚Äôs not really an advantage. It is a way of balancing out all the hidden disadvantages that the average girl faces in her journey of education.
Arguments against all of this do exist, and are regularly made. However, given that it is, at the end of the day, a narrative, it is not out of the question that it will change. It is not unimaginable that people may warm up to the idea, if misinformation is removed, or the effect of casual sexism is reduced.
In a nutshell, when it comes to people - nobody can claim to know.
Can numbers make that claim, then?
(Editor‚Äôs Epilogue)
Numbers can, certainly, corroborate the experience of our respondents, and attest the many points we‚Äôve tried to state in the epic-length narrative piece above, but numbers take time to be sieved through, and the piece above should, for any careful reader, manifest itself into a queue of questions they hadn‚Äôt thought of yet. We will answer them, and a lot more, in the next segment:
Supernumerary at work: What do the numbers say?
In the meantime, you can reflect on the questions you have, and critique the story in whatever way you wish to. Ta Da!

INTRODUCTION
This is a strange and historical time; we can all feel the significance of the moment, of a pandemic that has brought the world to a standstill. But today, nearly a year after the first case was reported, we are less concerned with the big picture and more worried about the daily details of living happy lives. Had we been asked last year how we would feel about an online semester, we might have looked at our beloved gadgets and shrugged: ‚ÄòI could probably manage a few months online. I‚Äôm glued to my laptop anyway.‚Äô And yet this is so very different from anything we could have imagined. Being glued to your laptop in a quiet room at home is not the same as sitting in your loud, busy hostel wing and trying to work. There is a disconnect.
This is why we bring you an analysis of how this transition has affected the students of IIT Delhi. We‚Äôll examine what everyone‚Äôs academic lives look like today, how socializing is taking place, and also think about some insights we received from non-student figures. And hopefully, along the way, we‚Äôll understand how everyone is living, scattered to their own little corners of the country, and feel a bit more connected.
ACADEMICS
Handling today‚Äôs academic experience feels like staring down an entirely unfamiliar beast. The semester is shorter, lectures are less accessible, most lab components are a bygone dream, technical hiccups are inevitable. It is undeniably frustrating. But then, this isn't to say that there aren't some pros along with the cons. The distractions of campus are absent, we can dictate our own workdays, commuting time is nonexistent, and attendance is usually unenforced. There are both restrictions and freedoms. Let‚Äôs look at which way the balance has fallen for most students.
Concentration on online vs campus lectures
Firstly, the ability to concentrate on lectures has gotten more difficult for most students across the PG and UG sections. This might be due to internet problems, as
40% of our respondents tell us that internet connectivity is their primary problem with live lectures
.
However, there is still a substantial number of students - 25% of the UG section and 12% of the PG section - who find it easier to concentrate from home. Seems like some of us are definitely better off without friends to mess around in the lecture hall.
Recorded vs live
Even though most profs prefer live lectures to recorded lectures because they‚Äôre a better approximation of offline teaching,
46% of students preferred recorded lectures
over live lectures, and 27% had no preference either way.
Also, there is a clear trend between this preference and the student‚Äôs CGPA. While only 39% of the students in the 9-10 range preferred recorded lectures, this number increased to 54% for students with CGPAs less than 7.
Problems with live lectures
Not surprisingly, the main problem faced by students in attending live lectures was internet connectivity. We see another dimension to the issue of internet connectivity in the fact that
among the students who faced financial challenges due to lockdown, 49% faced internet issues
as a primary problem and another 22% faced it as a secondary problem.
It does raise an eyebrow, however, that the
second most cited issue was household chores.
13% of our respondents say that being involved in household chores is their primary problem. The majority of these students (60%) are PG, which is understandable as they are older and have more household responsibilities.
We also see that a substantial number of students face issues due to odd class timings (11%) and the prof‚Äôs technological issues (12%). Understandably, over half of these students prefer recorded lectures to live lectures.
The environment
on campus and studying
How you like to study is something that‚Äôs unique to every person - you study alone, you have study groups, you study with music, you prefer the quiet, you study at a table, you study on a couch‚Ä¶ the variables are endless. So when asked, ‚Äò
Do you believe you studied better on campus?
‚Äô and the answer was a resounding yes.
74% of the UG section and 86% of the PG section preferred studying on campus.
However, a significant part of the student population also seems to be enjoying their academic at-home experience - as one ecstatic student put it, ‚ÄúI am studying much much
much
better at home, and the same is the case with 90% of my friends.‚Äù
8% of students -
the true survivors
- are indifferent to whether they‚Äôre studying at home or on campus.
Course policies
Besides
the teaching and studying, there‚Äôs another important component of any course - the structure and policies. That‚Äôs why we asked our respondents if their professors‚Äô course policies were in agreement with institute guidelines for the online semesters, and this is what we found:
In the Mechanical and Textile departments, the
number of students saying that the policies go against institute guidelines outweighs the number of students who say that they‚Äôre fine
. There is clearly a problem with either the course policies or their communication in these departments.
When we asked our respondents to give us their comments regarding this, the issues cited were-
Some professors are not recording lectures, e.g. in MTL717, so students with poor connectivity and electricity are missing out completely. Also, some courses still have attendance criteria, which goes against institute guidelines.
Some courses are having surprise quizzes that students miss due to connectivity issues, e.g. in APL102, MSL305/306, APL108 and some of the CS 3rd year courses.
Lab sessions are difficult to follow and neither are they recorded; many students feel that lab components should be deferred to Sem II-B.
Along the same lines, we asked students to rate from 1 to 5 how clear the professors‚Äô instructions were with respect to scheduling, grading and course policies.
The UG section rated the course instructions an average of 3.35.
The PG section rated the course instructions an average of 3.91.
SOCIALIZING
Our social lives have arguably taken the greatest hit this year. You can approximate classroom learning with live lectures and MS Teams‚Äô Together Mode, but it‚Äôs far more difficult to simulate hanging out at WindT after class or having a night out in SDA. Perhaps even more difficult is coordinating everyone‚Äôs erratic work-from-home schedules for a game of Among Us. So, we wanted to know how our respondents had been faring in different spheres of campus socializing.
Peer interaction
We felt that the most basic question to ask was:
how have interactions between friends changed over the lockdown
? Not surprisingly,
80% of students felt that their interactions with their friends and peers had decreased
, and another 13% reported no change.
We also wanted to know how many people had taken the opportunity of lockdown to make new friends. Around 25% of our respondents had expanded their friend circles, while 50% reported no change, and tragically, the remaining people said they had lost friends during
the
lockdown.
We also saw that
people whose interactions with their friends increased were also thrice as likely to have made new friends during lockdown
compared to people whose peer interactions decreased.
Additionally, people whose social interactions had not changed over lockdown were twice as likely to make new friends as people whose interactions had decreased.
New hobbies/club activities
No one who‚Äôs lived on campus can deny how useful club activities are in helping meet new people and keep up with old friends. So, we wanted to know how people‚Äôs club involvement had changed over the last six months. We found that nearly
60% of our respondents reported a decrease in club/sports activities.
This isn't surprising; a substantial number of students were stuck at home without connectivity, and a lot of places also had restrictions on outdoor activities.
We noticed that a certain category of students was far more affected than the rest. 66% of the UG population reported a decrease in club activities, as compared to 56% of the PG population. This could be because UG students were more involved in club activities before lockdown - they had 81% involvement as compared to the PG students‚Äô 72%.
Romantic relationships
It‚Äôs certainly hard to be away from your friends, but we‚Äôre told it‚Äôs much harder to be away from your significant other (
though we wouldn‚Äôt know; we are the 60%
). It‚Äôs been a long half year since
the
campus was closed, and there‚Äôs no talk of reopening anytime soon. Under these trying circumstances, we wanted to know whether students had been having problems in their romantic relationships.
The vast majority of the student population
(60%) had remained single through the lockdown
and, sadly, around 16% reported that their relationships got worse or ended. However, we were happy to find that nearly 23% of people had managed to either maintain the status quo or improve the quality of their relationships.
Of the PG students who were already in a relationship at the beginning of lockdown, around 27% reported that the relationship ended. By contrast, in the UG section, the number of relationships that broke up was only 12%.
MENTAL HEALTH
We asked students two questions:
Had they ever gone to a counsellor before lockdown? And had they considered it since lockdown started?
What we found was that, predictably, a vast majority of students had never sought counselling for mental health issues.
Only around 10% of the student population had been to a counsellor. However,
over 20% of students had considered seeking counselling after the lockdown began
. Among these people, the majority of them (70%) were students who had never been to counselling before. So, due to lockdown, a total of around 15% of our respondents considered going to a counsellor for the very first time. Given how much of a mental toll this pandemic has taken worldwide, this is unfortunately not surprising.
What is alarming is that when we looked at the respondents who had been more badly affected than most by the lockdown, the percentage of people who had considered going for counselling since lockdown increased sharply.
For students whose romantic relationships got worse or ended, a vast majority did not seek counselling, but around 43% considered it. Out of these people, 28% had never been for counselling before (compared to the average of 15%).
Similarly, in the case of students who had lost friends during the lockdown, 32% thought of seeking counselling, where 19% were
first-timers
to counselling. Among students whose peer interactions decreased, 16% thought about counselling for the first time during
the
lockdown.
However, most notable of all,
out of all our respondents whose families faced financial issues during
the
lockdown, 100% thought about going to a counsellor!
What‚Äôs more, nearly 75% of these students were considering counselling for the first time.
The average IITD student clearly feels reluctant about going to a counsellor; maybe they can‚Äôt access it, or they feel like they don‚Äôt need it, or some other problem. We‚Äôve seen, however, that due to the lockdown, a sizeable part of the population is thinking about counselling for the first time. We‚Äôve also seen that students facing adverse circumstances are much more likely to seek counselling during lockdown than they were before.

Teams, Meets and Webex : A Zoom in on the Online Semester Part II
Muskaan Jain

Feb 17, 2021
Academics
To understand the online semester better, we wanted to get a perspective that was different from what our respondents reported. For this, we spoke to a couple of professors -
Prof SD Joshi
, of the Electrical Engineering Department, and
Prof Reetika Khera
, of the Humanities and Social Sciences Department.
On being asked how they felt about classroom interactions in the online semester, both professors reported problems with engaging with students.
Prof Joshi: ‚ÄúI like the chalkboard kind of teaching, so it hasn‚Äôt been a pleasant experience. When you don't have the students in front of you, you don't know whether they are following or not. Neither do some students ask questions. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not interesting for me either.‚Äù
Prof Khera: ‚ÄúThere is something to be said for being able to see students in
the
class. If they‚Äôre zoning out, I might crack a joke. If they‚Äôre falling asleep, I might ask them to go wash their face. Sometimes, you can see that the student is not convinced by the logic you‚Äôre giving, so you can ask them to voice their objection. All this enhances the classroom experience, so engagement is much reduced online.‚Äù
Prof Joshi also had an interesting take on how to find this sem‚Äôs silver lining. On the topic of course emphasis, he explained, ‚ÄúTraditionally, more emphasis is laid on evaluation than on learning, but now it is not possible to conduct proctored examinations. So we could view this sem as an opportunity to give more emphasis to learning, maybe by giving students personalised practical-based assignments from which they could learn much more. Also, this sem introduced certain platforms to me, such as Piazza and EduPosse, and the kind of interaction they make possible is fantastic. In the case of EduPosse, it was possible for me to address the doubts of students
up to
the hour before the exam. So I strongly recommend that they be a part of the regular game [offline semester] too.‚Äù
Being the teacher for several economics courses which are all famously heavy on class interaction, we wanted to know how Prof Khera was handling her teaching plans and evaluation policies.
She told us, ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve had to use new ways of evaluation ‚Äì e.g. classroom
PowerPoint
presentations by students have now become 1-2 minute video submissions. The dangers of cheating have also meant that evaluation methods have to be as personalized as possible. In my case, that includes more
research-focused
evaluations. But for me, the hardest part of teaching online is setting an exam that I feel excited about. I‚Äôd feel very bad about inflicting a boring exam
for
students.‚Äù
When we brought up how hectic this online semester has been for students, both profs seemed clued-in and sympathetic. Prof Khera said, ‚ÄúI think for students the challenges of online learning are many ‚Äì on campus, there is some sort of ‚Äòlearning environment‚Äô. No one is going to walk in while class is on to ask, ‚Äòbeta, kuch chahiye?‚Äô At home, many have to fight to create this space. If they are home, they are bound to get involved in domestic chores as well, which might eat into study time. Moreover, in some ways, the classroom is a sideshow in the learning experience. So much of the learning is peer to peer while discussing and solving problems and doing assignments. So it seems like students are missing out on campus life more than classroom life.‚Äù
Prof Joshi said, ‚ÄúFrom the faculty side, there are hardly any infrastructural issues because IIT can take care of the logistics. I can just sit in front of my camera and deliver the lecture. But not all students have the required infrastructure. For example, one of my students was giving his viva in a dark room on his mobile phone. So that brought home the fact that all students are not blessed with all opportunities. Even if it was one student, we would effectively be denying him his education, but it‚Äôs worse than that; around 10% of any class has technical issues with attending online lectures.‚Äù
We went on to ask him what he thought of online cheating, and how to curb it. His views were quite unexpected. ‚ÄúI believe in trusting people. I mean, you do not gain much via mistrust. Last semester, I had to conduct online exams for final year students, and it was a pleasant surprise that quite a small number of people copied.  Most systems are based on mistrust, but I would go with a system based on trust. I‚Äôve seen that in most classes, 90% of students are trustworthy, so let's focus on this 90% and not design a system that solely focuses on the remaining 10%.‚Äù
We also wanted to know what Prof Joshi thought of the new audit criteria, which allows you to audit one department core and two electives in each online semester. Did he think it was a good idea to give students a freebie course every semester that they could ignore? Again, he surprised us. He said, ‚ÄúLook, we need to open our minds. People who are coming here are mature enough to know what they like and what they want to do in life. Just because you have twenty courses doesn‚Äôt mean you need to be interested in all twenty! You can‚Äôt
make
anyone learn anything; learning only happens when the motivation comes from within. So I think I‚Äôd trust students on what they‚Äôre doing. Trust and freedom are the most important things for drawing out a student‚Äôs best.‚Äù
For our last question, we asked Prof Khera how satisfied she was with her students‚Äô overall learning this semester. A tongue-in-cheek answer to a perhaps vague question, she remarked: ‚ÄúThat I can‚Äôt answer before the Minors‚Äô results come in!‚Äù
Mental Health
The question of mental health and counselling in IITD is clearly complex, so we asked Aakriti Ma‚Äôam, one of the SCS counsellors, to shed some light on the issue.
When asked what kind of issues her students were facing right now, she told us, ‚ÄúIn general, students are coming to me with anxiety about the future; for older students, they‚Äôre worried about how the world economy has changed, how their job opportunities are going to be affected, and so on. Even for younger students, the unfamiliarity with the mode of instruction was difficult to handle. Also, dates for the academic calendar were very uncertain.
However, what I think was the main issue for students was to deal with already pre-existing mental health problems. A lot of my returning students who already had existing issues, like a lack of motivation, or a low mood, or not being interested in doing things, have faced a decline in their recovery because of the lockdown. Due to the current restrictions, I can no longer advise them to meet a friend, or go out for a walk, or other such things.
Other than that, I've also seen some relationship issues because many couples are now separated by a distance and it's been going on for a long time. So mainly what I've observed is that a lot of issues are seeming larger than they would have otherwise, because students are confined to their homes and unable to move about.‚Äù
We also wanted to know if she had noticed any difference pre- and post-lockdown. ‚ÄúWe definitely saw an increase in the number of students reaching out around May, because that's when the lockdown was  extending, there wasn't any data about when they'd be able to come back, and so on; all the rules were changing.‚Äù
Another interesting thing that she pointed out was that the pattern of students reaching out had changed. ‚ÄúWhen things were normal, our caseload would increase just before every exam. Before minors and majors, we would see a sharp influx of cases. Then it would usually die down right after. However, now we're seeing a steady upward trend. And I don't think this has anything to do with exams, it‚Äôs just the fact that we‚Äôve all been stuck on pause with no end in sight. It‚Äôs creating constant stress on students.‚Äù
Finally, we asked Aakriti Ma‚Äôam if she had any advice on how to deal with the day-to-day stress of the online semester.
She told us, quite emphatically, ‚ÄúThe biggest piece of advice I could give is to start living within time boundaries. Let me explain.
‚ÄúToday, most of us have lost all sense of the passing of time. Since we‚Äôre working from home,  we‚Äôre not moving from point A to B to C throughout the day, and it seems like the day just passes without us realizing.
‚ÄúSo I would suggest that this is the best time to try to establish a routine and a sense of boundary when you‚Äôre doing some work. Schedule your day such that your work time is separate from your leisure time. Right now, everything is getting mixed up. But you have to fix times for things and try to stick to them. Keep leisure out of work time, and when it‚Äôs time to relax
then
work should be out of the picture.
‚ÄúNot setting time boundaries creates mayhem. Because of your poor planning, at the end of your day, you‚Äôll feel overworked. Also, many students have ended up taking on way more work than is sustainable because it‚Äôs work-from-home ‚Äì especially PG students. Setting time boundaries will prevent this from happening to a large extent. You also get an insight into what your day looks like. You don‚Äôt have to wake up every morning and ask yourself, ‚Äò
What now?

OCS and The Allegations
BSP
Oct 6, 2020
16 min read
Updated:
Oct 7, 2020
By and large, the Office of Career Services (formerly TnP) is the student body responsible for bringing companies to IIT Delhi for interns and placements as well as ensuring smooth conduct of further processes and subsequently, the interviews. Contextualizing the scenario, we write this piece at a time when there is widespread dissatisfaction in the student community on the modus operandi of the OCS and the recent events in that regard. A large part of the first phase of the internship season has passed, and the pre-processes for the placements have begun.
Many who have gone through phase one of the internship season in the past month have had a first-hand experience of the lackluster OCS has been often associated with. From not having their PORs and CGs updated on their resume, costing them potential interns, to battling out exams and elections while perfecting a CV that would decide whether they are shortlisted by companies, it would be an understatement to say that the students of IIT Delhi have a few grievances against the OCS. While the above-mentioned problems are ‚Äã
exclusive
to the rushed online semester that we leave behind us, there are a few problems that have been plaguing the student community for the past few years and have yet not been resolved. These include a lack of a proper verification mechanism for CV points, making it easy for people to lie on their resumes and putting the others who don‚Äôt at a grave disadvantage; clashing of interview slots wherein companies, with a blatant disregard for the candidates‚Äô other interviews, exceed their 1-hour time slot; candidates having upwards of 5 tests/interviews a day towards the end of which they are exhausted and unable to perform their best; candidates‚Äô having the interviews of companies they have specified to prefer less before the ones they prefer more. The aforementioned frustrations are incensed by what students believe to be an egregious lack of transparency between the OCS and the student body with delayed sharing of meeting links, no apparent feedback mechanism, or insight into the blacklisting process carried out by the OCS team members.
In this article, we aim to provide insight into the OCS and these issues. The first part of the article consists of an in-depth analysis of these problems, including comparing and contrasting OCS with similar bodies of other institutes wherever possible. The second part of the article gives the perspective of the OCS and explores the reasons behind the lack of resolution of some of the issues.
Let‚Äôs build the ‚ÄòResume‚Äô
While applying for internships and placements through OCS, the first thing a student does is start building their resume. The resume is, after all, the only thing companies would know about a student before a test or an interview, and also probably what an interviewer looks at first. It makes sense, therefore, that anyone would want to have control over their resume and be assured that the process isn‚Äôt inherently unfair or arbitrary. Unfortunately, most students don‚Äôt feel so assured.
As per the current format, you are required to draft a 2-page Curriculum Vitae consisting of your scholastic achievements, internships, projects, extracurriculars, and PORs. The internships you write about could be self- arranged or provided for by the OCS. Similarly, the projects can be your course projects or projects you do with the professors inside or outside IIT. The extra-curricular activities also include both the ones inside and outside IIT.
A schematic representation of a typical resume. Most students use the second page to mention only the courseworks, a major reason why it‚Äôs labelled ‚Äòredundant‚Äô and ‚Äòuseless.‚Äô
The current (above) format has been in place for the past two years. It‚Äôs credibility though, is contentious at best. As per its provisions, the first page of the resume is to be ‚Äò
f
‚Äã
illed by the student‚Äô‚Äã
and the second is auto-generated from the ‚Äã
e-certification portal.
To understand the core of the issue, it‚Äôs imperative to look at the unfolding of events leading up to the introduction of this format in the last session i.e. ‚Äã
2019. ‚Äã
The cracks began to emerge when a decision of the head of the OCS sparked a row among its student team and the general secretaries of various student boards. The decision was to forbid any form of resume verification whatsoever and allow only those points which were present in the IITD database, thus ensuring their genuinity. Concerns were raised regarding the non-existence of any such exhaustive database that held the entire set of information a student may want to enter. After multiple rounds of discussions, a new format was finalised: the two-page resume as you know it. A plan was initiated simultaneously to develop a new portal, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äã
X‚Äã
, containing all the credentials (scholastic achievements, internships, projects, extracurriculars and PORs) a student may want to write in their CV; once created, it was to replace e-certification as the source of verified information. SAC was entrusted with finding the developer and overseeing the construction. Wondrous was though the purpose fulfillment of the new two-page format. Neither did it release the load of the verification from OCS (we‚Äôll come to the mysteries of verification in a while); nor did the introduction of a second additional page add any value to the resume.
Cut to ‚Äã
2020
,
‚Äã
the two page format continues in its half-baked form. Faraz Mazhar (ex-Gsec. SAC), however confirmed that some significant progress had been made on the front of developing the new portal (X) before lockdown brought it to an abrupt halt. Pertinent questions are aplenty though: If the initial goal was to do away with the verification process, why did the OCS not wait until the replacement for the e-certification portal was ready? How did the introduction of a two page CV help the cause by any means?
The verification process, the sole thorn that OCS sought to pluck, continues to be a matter of obscurity as before. The E-certification portal is meant to keep track of a student‚Äôs PoRs and ECA achievements ‚Äã
internal to
IIT. OCS internships are also verified. But the students are free to write anything in relation to the other sections (scholastic achievements, internships outside of OCS, projects, extracurriculars that are external to IIT). Supporting documents are definitely asked for, but there is enormous uncertainty as to who checks the validity of the documents produced, and how strictly each point is verified. Without any sort of transparency about this, there is always a fear of arbitrariness in the mind of a student. You can‚Äôt help but wonder whether someone else was given a ‚Äòbetter deal‚Äô than you, whether you drew the short end of the stick. The timeline for this year is particularly telling of the possible overlooks in the verification process: the deadline for freezing ‚Äã
internship CV ‚Äã
this year
‚Äã
was ‚Äã
16th August
.
‚Äã
Given that most of the candidates make their submissions at the eleventh hour, it‚Äôs a rather dubious event that nearly all the CV‚Äôs were verified by the the morning hours of ‚Äã
17th August
.
‚Äã
Not to forget that the haze was compounded by the deadlines given by OCS, that gave very short notice at a time when students were facing the heat of their major assignments and exams. IIT Bombay, in that sense, provides an excellent example. We reached out to a member of their Placement Cell to know how they go about verifying resumes. Here‚Äôs how their method looks like: ‚Äã
There are two levels of checks. Each and every point in a resume is verified and validated twice to ensure little to no room for any error. This year, in particular, the student team had to work two days and nights straight to accomplish the task in a short span of time. The points which aren‚Äôt admissible are dealt with as per the guideline.
Before we proceed to the next set of problems, a ‚Äòtrivial‚Äô point needs to be mentioned. This year, OCS allowed students to write achievements and accolades for which their certificates lay at their hostel room, asking them to sign an undertaking declaring the same. A welcome step considering the hodgepodge that would‚Äôve ensued otherwise, but OCS did say their verification would take place once the campus reopens. We‚Äôll be watching.
Post the glory of Day 1
After the companies shortlist the candidates based on the CVs and tests, the interviews begin. In the experience of people who have undergone the whole process, the first day is mostly streamlined. The most prestigious companies come in on the first day, and only the shortlisted candidates are allowed in the venue. While students do complain about the scheduling of the interviews, as many find themselves giving back to back interviews, the process proceeds with little to no mishaps on the first day. Here there is maybe something to be learned from the way IIM Ahmedabad conducts its placements, where students get to vote for the day on which an industry comes and also get to give a priority order for the companies they apply to. Their schedule is different to be fair (they have 3 clusters, each of 7 days), but voting and priority order seem like useful suggestions prima facie.
Things however, start to unravel a bit on the second day, when the companies throw open their avenues to ‚Äò‚Äã
walk-ins‚Äã
‚Äô. A summary definition of walk-ins is as follows: If a company has been unable to fill the number of positions it came to recruit for, due to any possible reason, it opens up for all students at the venue who fulfill an objectively identifiable criteria (CG>7.5, for example). Students at the venue who qualify this metric are allowed to walk into the interview room, thus the name walk-ins. Most walk-ins are last moment decisions and aren‚Äôt declared beforehand, and the OCS does not recognize it as a formal event. Their conduct has long been fraught with unauthorised decisions and questionable fairness. A close look at the execution shall support the argument.
The organizational part of a walk-in rests completely in the hands of the OCS representative present around that venue, usually a freshman volunteer or, at best, a sophomore. Their tasks include collecting CVs, shortlisting eligible candidates, and sending them in for the interviews. A noteworthy and concerning aspect here is that in a walk-in, there is no demarcation between the students who clear the eligibility criteria. The OCS representative is given significant charge of the order in which a student goes into the interview room, which is crucial in a walk-in given the company closes as soon as its positions are filled up. While this does not happen in company HRs are proactive, misuse of this unchecked power is commonplace, and more often than not, representatives play with the order to benefit some seniors they are friends with/acquainted with. There are even cases where students ask the volunteers outright to help them with this. There have also been instances of hostel meetings being held days before placements to ask the OCS volunteers from that hostel to help the graduating seniors of the hostel by allowing them to go up in order for a walk-in, luring the volunteers with the prospect of a similar turn of events in their final year.
It‚Äôs difficult for us to examine the merit of the idea of a walk-in with an unbiased outlook, for truth be told, they provide jobs to a major chunk of the batch. The conflict as we see here is twofold: a part of students who benefit from this process happily walk-away after their walk-in, and the remaining who aren‚Äôt as lucky are left to bear the brunt. The lack of organization in the process is common to both and is the first level of problem. The end-result though ends up creating two different groups, the beneficiaries, and the sufferers, the latter being small in number. The beneficiaries and the sufferers arise out of one and the same problem, aggravated by irresponsible, oftentimes prejudiced, and unfair behaviour of their peers and juniors. Both the OCS and the student community need to pause and reflect here, for the burden to get rid of this specific problem falls equally on either shoulders.
The fault in their communication
Let us first try to understand the role that communication plays in the functioning of an organization like the OCS. The way the system is supposed to work is that the students raise issues and convey their point of view to the OCS. This should be followed by pushback from the organization, stating their constraints and obligations. The same process may then continue back and forth, and finally, an equilibrium be reached which sufficiently accommodates the students‚Äô demands, and also takes into account the administrative constraints and the point of view of the administration. It is important to note that the point here is not for students to just be given whatever they ask for. The administration and, indeed the OCS have a lot of valid reasons and constraints under which they take decisions. But the reality is that without active feedback from the students‚Äô point of view, these decisions just aren‚Äôt in the best interest of the students. If the students never even come to know about the point of view of the OCS, and vice-versa, there is bound to be alienation.
But why does the alienation and the communication gap exists? Firstly, the communication from OCS to the students is marred by a lack of clarity and a lackadaisical attitude. (This was illustrated by the fact that deadlines for CV verification were communicated just a few days earlier to students of the current session) No written or documented channel of communication exists, and some students don‚Äôt have anyone to reach out to during the placement process. A one-stop mail id does exist, but the responses from the central mail are often slow and inefficient.
If we are to look at the communication from students‚Äô end to the OCS, the levels drop furthermore. A feedback form is circulated after the placements are over to register the problems that may have been faced by the students. We had a look at the feedback form for the previous academic session, and it seems grossly insufficient to cover even the problems that we‚Äôve talked about in this short article.
Apart from 5 rankings of experience from 1-5, none of the other questions actually allowed students to raise grievances about the way OCS functioned. There was in fairness a ‚ÄòAny thoughts on an alternative placement process‚Äô. However, the whole form read a little bit like a deflection of responsibility. It was asking for students‚Äô general preferences with some issues, but there was very little scope for questioning and talking about the tasks OCS was involved in: resume verification, pre-processes, interview scheduling, preference allocation. It‚Äôs also interesting to note that the question that asked students to rate their ‚Äòexperience‚Äô did not seek to inquire about the changes that had taken place in that particular year (2019, when the format of resumes was changed).
Given how important communication is to their functioning, a well-designed feedback form that demands students to give their actual (and precise) opinions and does not limit questions to generic themes would probably give OCS more information and enable them to make better decisions. A final nail in the coffin is the haze over the conclusive nature of the feedback mechanism: Who draws the inference from the feedback form? What is the nature of responses received? What is the follow-up and so on...
The OCS Perspective
After reading the student‚Äôs perspective, we begin to think that there is something deviously wrong about the way OCS is operating. We won‚Äôt lie; we held a similar opinion. But upon talking to current and alumni student members who held executive, CTM and OC positions in the OCS, we were able to answer some of the common allegations that you might have towards the body. We‚Äôve tried to compress our conversations in the form of a FAQ for an ordered read:
Why does it seem like there was no coordination between the OCS and the academic department in regards to the training and placement schedule this year?
In normal circumstances, the training and placement schedule is laid down well in advance, and so is the academic calendar. These schedules are set in close coordination with the recruitment seasons of other IITs. Most students are well aware of the tentative dates for training and placement as they rarely change from year to year, and thus start their preparations well before the semester begins.
This year, due to tremendous uncertainties about reopening college and facilitating all student needs, the Senate approved the revised semester schedule on 29th July. The calendar specified 6th to 20th September as the timeline for the Internship season. There is however some ambiguity over the specification of dates by the 'Senate' itself since the Minutes of Meeting of the Senate
doesn't
outline any such decision.
And a student member of the Senate told us that it was never discussed in the Senate meeting.
We couldn't check for any other ways the information might've flowed across.
OCS members claim that they could only plan and release the recruitment season timeline after receiving the semester schedule. In the short window that followed the release of semester schedule and until major examinations commenced, the OCS conducted an online orientation (9th August) and set 14th August, a mere five day period, for students to build and submit the CV on the portal. After receiving several student requests, OCS also granted a 2-day extension for the same.
No relaxations were possible because OCS had to close all activities at least five days before examinations started, as mandated by the administration, even after having been suggested an extension by the OCS. Although the process of laying down a concrete schedule for the internship season was shifted entirely to online methods this year, it was still tedious. Team members lost significant sleep to make the process as frictionless and well-ordered as possible. When it came to addressing student grievances, the OCS had no authority, and the general admin was at most indifferent.
Most students were counting on their updated CGPA and 3rd-year PORs to pass company cutoffs, so why was the internship season scheduled before the conclusion of the spring semester?
For students who were on tenterhooks about losing internships due to a non-accomodating plan, the OCS avers that if not for the crunched schedule, students would have been at risk of losing more companies. Owing to the late notification of the semester schedule (29th July) by IIT Delhi‚Äôs Academic department, OCS had to redesign the internship calendar on short notice. In August, several IITs had commenced or were already done with OCS
activities, and so, many companies had finished hiring. Many companies would not have allowed a more delayed recruitment schedule since they have strict deadlines concerning the same. Moreover, OCS claims that the last day to upload the CV was decided by the OCS Chairperson and the Dean of Academics this year.
In whatever way we choose to look at it, someone always loses. Conducting examinations before August would have made it impossible for a lot of students with poor or no internet connections to finish their semester. Safe arrangements needed to be made for these students to transfer back to campus. Shifting OCS deadlines till after major exams would‚Äôve meant a lot of tier 1 one companies not attending placements.
Why isn‚Äôt there a full proof CV verification system so that no student gets away with false points? And who decides the CV blacklisting criterion?
The OCS maintains its position as a facilitation unit which is responsible only for providing training and employment opportunities to the students along with organising career workshops. According to ex overall coordinators, there is no real mechanism to check every point in a student CV. Many people have seen projects passed down year after year, and it‚Äôs left up to the recruiters to find out if students possess the requisite knowledge. When it comes to points ECAs and Scholastic Achievements, students are required to upload proof in the form of certificates for every point that they mention on their CV. Yet, even these documents can be falsely acquired or manipulated. The SAC is only responsible for verifying points for events that have been conducted by clubs in IIT Delhi itself.
The OCS does not verify these supporting documents for all the CVs; the rationale behind their decision is that the task of checking upward of 1000 CVs is exceptionally time-consuming. Therefore they resort to selective blacklisting, but the manner in which it is done is not disclosed. It appears that close to 10% of CVs are randomly blacklisted. This procedure is carried out by the staff employed at the OCS and is not in the hands of the student members. The blacklisted students are responsible for clearing their names by making sure the documents they uploaded to account for all the points in their CV. Ambiguous points that don‚Äôt have clear proof are removed from their CV. Failure to comply with these rules can result in expulsion from further OCS activities.
Another mechanism in use for keeping false points in check during placements is the flagging system. All student CVs are made public for peer verification, and students are allowed to non-anonymously flag points of their batchmates if they think they are incorrect. OCS then investigates the student CVs that have their points flagged numerous times. This procedure has often been looked down open for garnering a malicious spirit amongst students and was briefly discontinued two years ago.
The question of who is in charge of this verification process still stands, is it the administration, the OCS or the SAC?
Why do we find so many students complaining about missing their interview slots or test links? What is OCS doing about this?
According to OCS members, phase I of Internships went smoother this time than in past years. The primary reason for this was the distribution of interviews over four days as opposed to two. This move was facilitated because the internship season was conducted before semester II started. It also had two other significant affects - it resulted in less pressure on students because they no longer had to juggle classes and minors with intern preparation. The second was that day one and day two could accommodate more companies, and since most companies stress on getting a good slot during the first two days, participation from companies increased. OCS members report that interview slots usually clash for a small number of students generally from the CS department, who have a lot of shortlists on day 1. This time around far less slot clashes were reported and when interview slots did crash, the POCs (point of contact) for the particular company requested them to reschedule interviews, although this did not work out all the time.
One problem that arose this time was when test and interview links failed to reach students on time. OCS members reported that these mishaps mainly occurred when companies took charge of providing their own test links, and OCS had no role to play. Attempts were made to better communication between all participants of a particular test or shortlist by creating WhatsApp groups with one POC to the company.
During interviews, the OCS team facilitated MS team groups for all companies, but a lot of them preferred to conduct their interviews on other platforms.
What benefits do the OCS members experience during training and placement?
Many students believe that OCS members have a distinct advantage during the placement season. This is untrue as there is no way an OCS member can influence any part of the proceedings officially. We talked to alumni members of the OCS team, and they reflected that as an Overall Coordinator, they worked with students and recruiters alike, which provided them with valuable leadership experience. OCS members, mostly from 3rd year onwards, hold a lot of responsibility. As underlined in the OCS Work Timeline, members contact companies, allot rooms, manage accommodation, proctor tests, mediate between the companies and the students, among other things. Although CTMs and OCs know certain things beforehand like which companies are coming and which are not, there is no significant benefit from this. The significant harm, however, is real. Members receive 100s of text messages concerning OCS processes from students who expect them to respond promptly and politely. Right until interview days, many members are still in talks with companies convincing them to come and recruit. Managing companies, students, and all the trouble that a training and placement day can bring along with constant criticism is exhausting, and OCS has seen a lot of students leave the cell due to this pressure. The student community has been quick to point fingers at the students working at OCS in the past, but we need to see that these are students undergoing the same intern or job pressures as the rest of us.
CAN THERE BE A FINE BALANCE?
The solution to any and all problems that exist within OCS needs to come from the student community. Sure, the administration needs to take note as well and work in conjunction with the OCS to improve and improvise. Our aim with this article was not to thrash or defame a student body as most of us have in the past, hiding behind the veil of anonymity. We sought to compile the problems, look for possible reasons and determine the causes from the other side, the one our confirmation bias doesn‚Äôt let us see.
As to can there be a fine balance? ; can the OCS step up and deliver its best, work out rational and feasible solutions, and an effective feedback mechanism?; can the student community be fairer in their critique? We don‚Äôt know the straight answers, none of us do. Only time will tell.

Plight of Tech clubs
BSP
Oct 3, 2020
9 min read
Clubs are a very essential part of a college student's life. An escapism from the hectic academic lifestyle is always needed, and this is where clubs come into the picture and provide you an avenue to indulge in hobbies and interests with other similar people like you. A technical institute like ours, is synonymous with research and technology in the minds of millions of countrymen outside these walls. Though research and development is on, on the higher and formal level of the institute, the students, usually undergraduates, don't have any major recourse to flirt with the functional aspect of technology. Technical clubs come in to fill this gap.
Technical clubs are student organisational bodies working in the field of technology and research. They are formed by the motivated ‚Äòengineers‚Äô of the institute, who love to play with ideas and build products from scratch, competing against hundreds of institutes across the world in a jamboree organised by some enterprise or institute. Broadly speaking, there were 7 technical clubs in IIT Delhi that are presided over by the student body CAIC, of which six remain functional today.
AXLR8R:
AXLR8R works with the aim of practical implementation of machine theory to manufacture a formula race car. Over the years, they have improved on the technology of the engine and transmission, with most recent cars being electric. Their vision extends to designing and manufacturing the car every year, all inside their humble shed in the Central Workshop, which is used to bring laurels to the institute and the country in International competitions. In a first, probably in the history of the club, they cleared the scrutiny of the car to be able to drive it in the Formula Student Germany 2019.
Robotics:
Robotics club as the name suggests, is involved with the design and materialisation of robots to partake in esteemed competitions like Robocon and various technical fests. Apart from this, they conduct workshops and lectures and are involved in many summer and semester projects as well. Their Intro to Robotics course for freshers is the most interesting hands-on experience one can get in his first year: making their own robots using Arduino and sensors has a thrill of its own.
Physics and Astronomy Club:
Physics and Astronomy Club consists of a group of enthusiasts who come together to discuss various ongoing things about physics and the emerging questions in Science. They organise events which interests the general audience in the view of astronomy by organising various observation sessions and lectures. The club aims at increasing the general knowledge of the audience through the medium of such events. Even the polluted Delhi sky does not stop them from finding the right night to host an observation session of various celestial highlights.
Economics Club:
The club aims for a forum where people can come together to learn and discuss economics and to foster a culture of economics in the college.They conduct events like lectures, workshops and Tuesday night discussions. Competitions on Game theory are also organized by the club.
DEV Club:
The club aims to improve the technological and development culture using open source codes in the institute and use software to help students in general. They conduct different workshops, hackathons and lecture series and collaborate with startups as a part of their work.
IGEM:
The International Genetically Engineered Machine; An organization present in various colleges, the main is to research in genetics and represent IITD in the prestigious Jamboree held in MIT every year. Apart from that, it organises competitions in their field during Tryst. Due to the lack of enough guidance from the institute, the club did not participate in iGEM this time.
Aeromodelling Club:
The main vision is to further nurture the interest of students in Airplane and drone design and continue teaching them about its various aspects. It aims to encourage aeromodelling activities and provide a platform to students enthusiastic about it. It also organizes Boeing National Aeromodelling Competition (BNAC) Finals, which are held here at IIT Delhi annually.
PRESENT SITUATION AND COMPARISON WITH THE CULTURAL CLUBS AND SPORTS
The first and foremost difference between cultural and tech clubs is their organisation under a board. Cultural clubs have a separate board to look after their needs and requirements. Technical clubs, on the other hand, don't have that privilege of exclusive attention and are under the same CAIC which also constitutes departmental societies and schools. The structure of the cult clubs and tech clubs are fundamentally different as well. Cultural clubs have a uniformly followed organisational structure of 13 reps and 1 secretary. Each technical club has a different hierarchical structure and the number and authority of different PORs are also different. This non-uniformity is because of the fact that these PORs are not just administrative in nature but skill-based.
Technical clubs require a lot of time and effort on the student‚Äôs side, and it is not unreasonable to assume that the students who are interested in it would like to pursue it further as a plausible career option. However, the clubs do not currently offer any opportunities or options for them to do so, discouraging most of the resume driven students from continuing in the club beyond a certain point. This can be observed from the decreasing trend of the club members in the senior years. Also, the high potential of the clubs is not realised due to their lack of popularity among student body and professors. The cultural clubs and sports enjoy fully funded official ‚ÄòInter IIT‚Äô meets. Inter IIT tech meet isn't officially recognised by the Inter-IIT council and hence no support to the students is officially given in this regard, unless of course, the professor is gracious enough to give them a relaxation for it. This is reflected in the fact that IIT Delhi sent a contingent for Inter IIT Tech Meet last year, for the first time ever. The same is true for other international and national competitions wherein students participate at their own expenses, sometimes at the cost of their academics. While official provisions like make-up labs, ease in the process of reminors exist for people participating in Inter IIT Sports, the students partaking in tech competitions are left helpless with all the paperwork to be done even to claim attendance, while many suffer a grade down for not having enough attendance.
The things that make any club or organisation successful is a well-committed team, an adequate amount of budget, and the cooperation of the administration which presides over it. More than the funding and the participation, administrative cooperation is needed on top priority to make these clubs actively functional. Many pieces of the equipments that these clubs use are expensive and can not be bought by the students directly, something which the system demands and promises to reimburse later (after continuous requests and pestering). CAIC has a certain amount of budget allocated for each technical clubs based on their needs, however, that does not suffice their needs always.
AXLR8R receives nearly 8 lacs from the institute, but each car they make costs about 30 lacs. To cover up for these additional costs, they look for sponsors who could support them in some way or the other. Even if they get a sponsor who is ready to pay a monetary sum, it‚Äôs a long long time before the sum reaches the students as it gets stuck in the accounts department due to the account in question being an IRD government account. Thus, a strict scrutiny and audit system is present along with restrictions on money being withdrawn.
This hampers the pace of work and motivation of the students.
WHERE ARE THE CLUBS AT?
The survey was taken by 222 people, out of which 138 were freshers (both UG and PG) and 84 were non-freshers.
DevClub is the most popular club amongst the first year nascent who are yet to ‚Äújoin‚Äù it. With almost 60% of them describing some interest in becoming a part of it. While almost all the other clubs have almost 40% of students lured in them. Leaving out only a meagre 7% of the total surveyees clubless.
This statistics is may be foretelling the success of the DevClub, or are they? When asked about the major reason why they want to be a part of a technical club, 66% of the freshers replied with the eerie two-letter word - CV. Which begs the question, is it their unparalleled curiosity in coding, or is it the same interest which makes everyone from AIR 1 to AIR 60 opt for IITB CS?
As we go beyond the freshers to the more experienced and mature(?) strata of the student community, we ask some similar questions. When asked which club were they a part of during their first year, we see quite an astonishing trend to what we observed in case of interest among freshers. We actually notice that the most popular club for this question is actually the Robotics club closely followed by DevClub, with almost all the other clubs having little participation. This summit of Robotics club against DevClub either implies its efficiency in recruiting people or an unprecedented increase in the popularity of DevClub. It also describes how even though most freshers are interested in many of the technical clubs, the clubs fail to provide an environment which can hold these freshers to cling to them. With 33% of students not being a part of any club, the next question unfolds another amusing insight about the technical clubs. As per our survey, while most of the other clubs hold onto the people that join them in first year, Robotics Club ends up losing most of them. 75% of the students who join Robotics Club in their fresher year, leave it in the subsequent years. 75 is not a small number on any scale. This is a troubling observation about the functioning of the Robotics Club, with the most common excuses of leaving out being: ‚ÄúI got bored/ work was no longer fulfilling/ lost my interest‚Äù and ‚Äú Self funding was required/ I had to invest too much of my own money to actually do something useful‚Äù.  The picture that our survey paints is not colourful, but it shows some positivity regarding their retention rates, and growing enthusiasm among freshers.
CAIC AND UPCOMING REFORMS
Q/A of the interview with CAIC G.Secy: Sarthak Kala
Many of the tech clubs have pointed out that they have very less involvement with CAIC and have only one or two meetings with CAIC per year. What do you have to say about this?
SAC and CAIC both are councils. So CAIC G.Secy can‚Äôt involve much with tech clubs since there are three parts of CAIC. So we will follow the example of SAC to resolve this, following the path of last G.Secy there will be a board for tech clubs. For this to happen, we will appoint a Secretary for all tech clubs (similar to BRCA G.Secy). There is a senate meeting at the end of October, in which this proposal will most likely pass. A committee will be formed and if the secretary does good work and the plan is successful, then a board will be formed just like BRCA was formed from SAC.
Why does IIT Delhi have very less participation in Inter-IIT Tech meet?
The inter-IIT council decided that they will not recognize Inter-IIT tech meet as official meet, unlike the cult and sports meet. So different IITs can come together for a tech meet but it will not be considered official. That‚Äôs why the participation is less from IIT Delhi. Also it‚Äôs not just IIT Delhi, but in other IITs as well there is less participation in tech, as compared to other colleges like NSUT.
Tech clubs don‚Äôt have a proper structure unlike cultural clubs. Everyone who works in a tech club has a POR. Do you plan to fix this?
This is not related to POR. This is a club dependent issue. Unlike cultural clubs, tech clubs have different requirements like junior executive, etc. The tech clubs secy will not interfere with the way the club functions. It‚Äôs up to the clubs to decide their structure.
Tech clubs have to face a lot of issues related to funds and reimbursement. What is the reason behind that?
The main problem is funds. The Tech club fund is under IRD, which is a govt account. So there are a lot of restrictions and there is strict scrutiny and audit system. This causes problems like late reimbursement, only able to withdraw a fixed amount of money etc. We are planning to move it from the IRD account to FITT account which will resolve the issues.
What do you have to say about the less popularity of tech clubs in comparison to cultural clubs?
The tech clubs are driven by some national or international competitions. They start as a student chapter with the vision of participating in these competitions, while expanding further. The popularity will come soon, as the clubs become properly managed.
There is more participation now than before. Clubs like PAC have grown. They recently invited a person from NASA. They have also held moongazing and other sessions. We have started targeting these clubs one by one. We have proposed a budget for this tenure. This will get discussed in the upcoming senate meeting. The reason that the PAC budget was zero last year is that their OC performed very poorly 2 years back, and this changed their status from club to student chapter. Eventually the dean wants more participation to give more funds. Now the recent OCs have worked very well and they are back as a club and hopefully their proposed budget will get passed in the next meeting.
CONCLUSION
It is apparent that the current state of the technical clubs in is not as good as should be expected in a premier ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô institute like IIT Delhi. One of the major problems is the attitude of the community to ‚Äòwork‚Äô towards building a CV, which certainly renders technical clubs helpless because all they offer you is immense knowledge in the particular domain. The lack of clarity in a typical IIT student leaves them with no choice but to keep ‚Äòtrying‚Äô out various opportunities available. This leaves tech clubs start off high with huge participation,  but as they become demanding with respect to time, people cut themselves off from them to continue their pursuit of happiness.
However, despite these problems, tech clubs have seen improvement in recent years. The activity of these clubs has increased, with multiple keynote lectures and workshops being organised this semester, while AXL8R recently achieved the country best position in Formula Student Germany. Factoring in the promise to sort the reimbursement issues by the CAIC G.Sec and the possibility of formation of a Board of Technical Clubs, the future of these clubs certainly looks good.

The PursuIIT of Happyness
Pratyush Pandey
Aug 1, 2020
22 min read
Introduction
The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are among the most difficult schools in the world to get into. The University of Oxford accepts one out of five applicants. IITs take in just one out of
100. While growing up, we observe the reverence our families have for cousins who crack
IIT-JEE, and how the newspapers never miss a chance to highlight the top salaries and other achievements of IITians. So it comes of little surprise that for any child with ambitions of becoming an engineer, getting into an IIT looks like the pinnacle of achievement. So, with a single-minded focus on achieving this goal, we start running the race to chase after ‚ÄúThe IIT Dream‚Äù.
However, most of the people who put in the requisite work, and get the results they need to reach IIT and realise this dream, find themselves lacking the satisfaction that they always imagined getting when they put in the 2+ years of work getting to IIT. Constantly under pressure from their peers, and carrying high expectations from their families, and especially themselves, it‚Äôs not always an easy ride for a student at IIT. And with the rising number of cases of self-harm, mental health issues and suicides across IIT - it becomes imperative to find out why the joy of getting into one‚Äôs dream college wears off before it even sets in.
The purpose of this article is to try and find out the reasons for unhappiness among the spectrum of the student demographic and to appropriately gauge the happiness and satisfaction levels. Since measuring these levels is a difficult task, BSP floated the first-ever institute scale student happiness and satisfaction survey, to strike up the stigmatised conversation about mental health. It received an overwhelming response, gathering about 1038 entries over a period of 7 days from both UG and PG students, across various disciplines, years and backgrounds in IITD. Hence the data collected, and the analysis that follows should be a reasonable estimate of the IIT Delhi student body as a whole.
About the Survey
Containing around 25 questions and completely anonymous and voluntary, the survey was floated by BSP, IITD internally through webmail, WhatsApp and Facebook groups. It contained two sections - the first related to the social circles, sleeping habits, happiness and satisfaction levels of respondents, while the second asked about their use of Institute sanctioned counselling services (SCS, YourDost) and their opinion about these services. The survey
gathered over 1039 entries within a week - with 782 UG entries (roughly 21.5% of the total UG strength) and 257 PG entries.
Among those who responded, 378 were in the first year, 292 in the second, 176 in the third, 150 in the fourth, and 42 students in their fifth (or higher) years of study respectively in their particular fields of study. This also correlates to how long a time these respondents have spent in IIT so far.
The factors considered and analysed in this form are only indicative and non-exhaustive. Measuring stress and happiness levels is a challenging task - especially since stress levels are expected to vary greatly during the semester, and reach its peak before exams or important deadlines stacked one after the other. This survey was conducted in the third week of January, about 1.5 weeks before Minor 1. We also acknowledge that different individuals have a varied level of responses to different stress-inducing stimuli and a highly relativistic concept of what happiness is and how happy and content they are with lives in the status quo. Hence while designing this survey we set up some trustable precedents to look up to, to correlate the factors that cause happiness or contentment in most people, with how IITians themselves rate their happiness with their lives, both academically and socially. Finally, we talk about the institute sanctioned services to combat mental health issues - namely the Student Counselling Services (SCS), YourDost, and student‚Äôs opinion about these services. Let‚Äôs delve into the reasons behind those dark circles, stress lines and receding hairlines.
Ain‚Äôt no rest for the wicked? (Aliter - Sleep is for the weak)
Between classes, exams, assignments, club activities and deadlines, IITians aren‚Äôt getting nearly enough sleep each night, which can have a major impact on their physical and mental health as well as their GPAs. Sleep deprivation seems to go hand in hand with college life - where the only way to make enough time for everything comes down to sleeping less. But catching enough Z‚Äôs can help you earn more A‚Äôs. Everyone has heard that an average adult needs at least 6 - 8 hours of daily sleep, but sleeping early and waking early can be of benefit too, a study suggests.
The average IITian seems to deviate far from this ideal behaviour though. Here are the sleeping times for UG students of IIT Delhi on usual academic days.
Here is the same for the PG Students.
A simple analysis shows that people with extreme bedtimes (3 am - 5 am and 5 am +) remain a minority. Almost half (48.7%) of UG students go to sleep at 1 am - 3 am, and overall 76.7% UG studentssleep between 12 am - 3 am.Compared to 28.5% and 50.8% respectively for the PG students, there is a significant difference in trends of bedtime, with the PG students seemingly more capable of managing a schedule with a more reasonable bedtime. For example, 22.3% PG students sleep between 11 pm-midnight, which on the UG side is a meagre 9.1% of the total students. The most popular sleeping time is 1 am - 3 am on the UG side, and 12 am - 1 am on the PG side.
What is interesting is how it will compare with the amount of sleep. Here are the hours of sleep UG students get on usual days -
Here are the same stats for PG students :
The number of hours slept must be viewed in conjunction with the bedtime statistics. Last time we established how the PG students statistics show a trend towards earlier bedtimes.
As previously, people with <4 and>8 hours of sleep are a minority for both UG and PG
populations. Interesting trends emerge as we go higher. Only 32.9% of UG students sleep for
6-7	hours, and 31.2% sleep for 5-6 hours. 7-8 hours bracket shows only 16.3% population. When compared to PG students, they show respective percentage figures of 42.6%,18.8% and 24.2%. So overall trend points towards not only more reasonable sleep timings but also towards more sleep in general for the PG students. This might be attributed to more awareness towards health due to being at a more advanced stage in life, but that is hypothetical.
Note that a very considerable chunk of the UG population, about 46.7%, sleeps less than 6 hours a day. Their ranks are joined by about 28% of the PG population. That is below the recommended amount of sleep a healthy adult should be getting and might invite unhealthy repercussions for their minds and body. More interesting trends are revealed when the sleep times are analysed in conjunction with the bedtimes. Ideally, to wake up in time to grab 6-7 hours of sleep and breakfast for that 8 am class students should sleep by 12.30 - 1. This is where a huge chunk of both UG and PG population falls out by far, which could imply most people would be either inclined to miss breakfast or miss the morning class itself, which could affect their health and academic performance.
The exam season brings with it not just increased stress and business for the night mess, but also an aggravated period of sleep deprivation. As shown below, a whopping 76.3% of UG respondents reported getting less than the recommended safe 6 hours of sleep during this period, with 27.5% people entering the ‚Äúless than 4-hour zone‚Äù.
Running a similar analysis on our PG respondents reveals a whopping 71.9% students getting less than the recommended safe 6 hours of sleep during this period, with 17.2% people entering the ‚Äúless than 4-hour zone‚Äù. Unlike before, these numbers are almost comparable to the UG students. Does this imply students are panicky during exam time irrespective of their degree?
So, is IIT to blame for the sleep deprivation of its students? Is the hypercompetitive nature of our academic space literally taking our sleep away? Well, Yes‚Ä¶. But also No.
According to the National Sleep Foundation, the ideal sleep range for young adults (18 - 25 years) is 7 - 9 hours. A healthy 70% of students slept within this optimal range before coming to IIT but this figure drastically reduces to 21% after coming to IIT and to a very low figure of just 13.7% during minors. (with little to no major variations across the years of study). The foundation states that sleeping less than 7 hours also increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses. It also debunks the current notion that studying more during exams at the cost of your sleep will get you good grades. Here are the data for UG and PG students -
PG -
This sleep deprivation isn‚Äôt without visible consequences. As per our survey, a staggering 63.2% of people feel unproductive during the afternoon which is also backed by the theory - the glucose spike in the body after eating lunch combined with the circadian dip gives you a period of fatigue between 2 - 4 PM. This is followed by the morning time where 53.2% of students feel unproductive. Note that the effect this has in students being able to be very attentive during morning classes and afternoon labs are left to the reader to infer. It is also known that sleep deficits cause sluggish attention spans and working memory and lack in productivity to perform efficiently to their fullest in day to day activities - which may lead to a loss in the ability of IITians to excel and cope with the pressure to the best of their abilities.
When asked which aspect of their lives they saw increasing the most with more hours of sleep, the response had little variance:
Productivity - 63.6%
Happiness - 54.8%
Calmness - 64.4% Physical Health - 56.2%
PG:											UG:
Finally, a whopping 73% of students thought that their mental well-being is affected the most due to lack of sleep, followed by Academics (58%) and Physical Health (52%). This is very important, especially considering people sleep too less during exam season when they find their calmness, productivity and academics affected due to sleep deprivation.
So what keeps IITians up at night? On plotting the major reasons given by the students, academics has shown to keep up 700 students out of 1038 sampled, showing a near 70% stay up due to study commitments.
It can be seen that 2nd and 3rd-year students majorly stay up at night due to academic reasons whereas 1st-year students, due to TV shows - which suggests that freshers are comparatively laxer than 2nd and 3rd-year students who recognise the importance of academics, faced with internship and job semester.
However, here comes a really interesting point: when a graph was plotted between the amount of sleep gotten in a day and CGPA of the respondent, the relationship came out to be almost independent with a slight dip in hours slept at around 7.5.
What this suggested was people trying to overburden themselves with performance pressure and ending up giving up on their sleep ended up being under satisfied with their performance. It must be understood that even though hard work and effort are necessary for a good score (as is also suggested by the plot), mental well-being and physical health should not be completely ignored.
Finally, diving deeper into the data reveals a few more interesting analyses. Comparing the sleep habits of students across various years of study in IIT reveals as student seniority increases, or equivalently as the amount of time spent at IIT increases, students‚Äô bedtime gets later. It appears that freshers retain their pre-IIT sleeping habits before they start burning the midnight oil eventually. The number of people who slept between the hours of 12 - 1 was most prone to a change to later bedtime as the number of people sleeping at that time decreased by 14% and the number of people sleeping between 1-3 AM increased by ~16% as the year increased. The post 5 AM bracket which had almost no takers in the first year despite the large sample size had more takers with seniority despite the lesser sample size of the population.
Here is the data for better visualisation for each year of analyses.
Study commitments, being a cause of loss of sleep for students leads us to look at how sleep of students is affected when academic stress is at its highest, the examination period.
On moving from regular workday to minors, the % of students getting less than 5 hours of sleep increases from ~15 % to ~50 %. This % of people who sleep less than 5 hours during minors can be seen to be highest among 2nd, 3rd and 4th years which tend to be the most academically stressful years, allegedly due to difficulty in juggling between extra-curricular activities and academics led to increasing stress and decreasing happiness levels. The pressure of securing internships and third-year PoRs can also be attributed to the increasing stress levels and pressure to perform academically.
The portion of people sleeping less than 4 hours drops in the 4th year, the portion is still higher than those found among the first years. A major chunk of time in the freshman year is spent in exploring different activities resulting in laxity towards academics, which is why more people in higher years reported studying as a major sleep delaying reason in higher years and freshers reported the main reason to be non-academic, chiefly club activities. This laxity, in turn, causes higher academic pressure in the later years.
Lastly, we draw a distinction between the sleeping time and schedules of students based on gender.
Sleeping times: There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any real difference between the two groups while it would be safe to say that the females prefer to sleep a bit late as compared to the males.
Almost no female prefers sleeping before 10 and their subsequent percentages are higher for later timings as compared to the male counterparts.
Sleeping Hours: Here as well, there is no major difference between the two. However, a higher percentage of females have sleeping times closer to healthier limits (somewhere between 6-8 hours) as compared to the males who have a slightly lower percentage in this group and higher percentages towards the extremities.
An IIT degree is what you make of it?
Before students go to IITs, they spend one or two years in a bubble where getting into an IIT is all that matters in life. When they get admitted, they are suddenly put on a pedestal by everyone. From such a bubble of adulation, it can be very difficult to adjust with the reality at IITs where 50% of them will be below average, 20% of them will be at the bottom of their class and quite a few would fail and drop out as well. The 2017 freshman survey conducted by BSP revealed for 80% of UG students, it was the first time they were staying alone and exposed to a life of minimal supervision. This independence comes at a cost - It is very easy to fail and very difficult to live with failure - especially if you have never experienced it before and are completely alone when you are experiencing it for the first time. In most cases, you cannot even confide in your old friends, parents, relatives, siblings etc. because they have put you on a pedestal.
In this section, we will analyse the Happiness and Satisfaction levels of the IITD student body. We will then proceed to link it with various factors like social circle, empathy towards their peers, CGPA, optimism about future, and of course, sleeping habits. Let us begin.
1.	Satisfaction with IIT Delhi
-	When we talk about negative responses, close to 500 UG students and 110 PG students were unoptimistic about the future, and believed IIT had failed their expectations. On the positive side, 250 UG and 110 PG students seem to have a positive and optimistic outlook.
-	We have approximately 790 UG students and 230 PG students who have filled up the form. Hence, approximately 63.2% of UG students foresee a gloomy future and are unsatisfied with their lives, as compared to PG population which is split roughly halfway between having a positive and negative outlook. The significantly more gloomy UG state of mind may be put down to having had more recent ‚Äòlife set hai‚Äô propaganda outside IIT, as well has not being used to this new level of competition and stakes yet.
-	The students on campus, on asked about their satisfaction level with IIT said that they were overall disappointed with IIT, with dissatisfaction levels increasing as the year increases but dropping in 4th year (albeit always staying above 50%). This might be due to the survey being conducted right after job semester and 4th years becoming complacent about leaving IIT.
-	When plotting the satisfaction levels of people with their life at IIT with the amount of sleep they get, satisfaction levels can be seen to rise from 17.4% among people who sleep less than 4 hours a day to 51% among people who sleep 8 hours or more, indicating clearly more sleep could lead to higher levels of satisfaction.
-	On comparing satisfaction levels with reported levels of happiness, 29 out of 397 people who rated themselves below average on happiness, we‚Äôre satisfied with how they spent their time in IIT. The remaining 316 were unsatisfied. 199 said their unsatisfaction resulted from career opportunities, 221 blamed it on their social lives, and 53 were generally optimistic about the future and had an idea of what they wanted to do after graduation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know about academics, they're fine.. but I feel unsatisfied in terms of what I have been able to do in extracurriculars.. and feel like I‚Äôm not enough if I‚Äôm not being ‚Äòmachau‚Äô", one such person said.
-	Out of all, 236 people were satisfied by their use of time in IIT (their average self-rated happiness scale is 3.12 out of 5). 615 people said IIT failed to fulfil their expectations, and of these, 422 blame it on interpersonal relations, 350 on their career. 480 of these people also reported being ‚Äúgenerally optimistic‚Äù of what the future held for them.
2.	Happiness Levels
-	We asked students to rate their happiness levels in life right now on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being Extremely Satisfied and 1 being very Dissatisfied.
Average Happiness: 2.82/5
For people who‚Äôve sought professional help: 2.59 For people who haven‚Äôt: 2.86
For people who‚Äôve been to SCS: 2.67
-	Clearly, these numbers, which on a scale of 1-5 seems to hover around a mid 2.5, is alarming, and here is why.
-	Here is how the UG students rated their happiness
1 - 14.56%	2 - 22.78%  3-34.17%	4-20.25%	5-8.24%
-	Here are the same numbers by PG students
1 - 12.6%	2-23.9%	3-33.07%	4-22.17%	5-8.26%
-	Hence, we observe very negligible differences across the UG and PG population. The stats are roughly Gaussian, tending towards unhappy for both. Unhappy students outweigh happy students on both sides and those who are truly happy seem to be a minority.
-	Here is how the happiness levels depend on the time you spend at IITD:
With a closer analysis, we found that percentage of people with happiness rating 1, 2, and 3 (ie below average) remains same in all years, except the rating of 1 takes a 10% jump after 5th year. Only 5th years have a significant variation with the rest of the years and have higher % of people with a lesser happiness rating as compared to the other years.
-	We further analyse how happiness levels may (or may not) affect the student‚Äôs CGPA. Our intuition, of course, dictates here that students with higher CGPA will be happier or satisfied with life, but the reality is there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much difference in reported average happiness levels of people with CGPA 7-8 and those with 9-10. In fact, drastic change in visible happiness levels is only observed when a student‚Äôs CGPA falls below 7, which might be attributed to the fact that 7 is the Cut-off for sitting for placements or internships in many companies, or for contesting and holding most institute level PoRs.
(FIG: the happiness index increases from 2.109 at 5-6 to ~3 at CG 9-10)
-	We tried to find a correlation between student‚Äôs satisfaction with IIT Delhi and their reported happiness levels. We discovered that irrespective of the happiness level, students were the most dissatisfied with their social circles and interpersonal relationship with IIT Delhi.
-	These findings are represented in the graph below. Here the most unhappy population in IIT Delhi refers to those who rated themselves with a 1 (on a scale of 1-5). While the happiest population rated themselves with a 4 or a 5.
-	Comparing satisfaction levels based on gender revealed that the males tend to be a tiny bit more satisfied/ happy as compared to the females whereas the ones who didn‚Äôt prefer gender disclosure don‚Äôt even seem halfway satisfied. However, neither of the groups seems to be very happy with the way their lives at IIT are. The averages are mostly around the halfway mark and thus need to be considerably improved.
3.	Social Circles and Interpersonal Relations
-	We asked students to tell us about their social circle and the friendships they formed here at IIT Delhi. This section analyses the responses and attempts to relate them meaningfully to the other factors that seem to dictate happiness.
-	Talking about UG students first and trying to look for any broad trends in friendship, we observe four major categories: 26.4% of people have a lot of friends but feel close only to a few. 10% people do not feel close to their friends, 12% feel they can rely on their close friends for anything and 13.8% have only a small group of friends, with whom they feel close.
-	For PG, there is much greater homogeneity as compared to UG students: 29.7% are friends with a lot of people and few close to a few of them. 13.3% have friends but don‚Äôt feel close to any of them, 15.6% have only a few close friends. A new category emerges of people who don‚Äôt have friends and enjoy being alone (11.7%), which was a minority in UG populace (3.8%).
-	In the earlier analysis, we observed that people cited their current social circles and quality of interpersonal relationship with the primary cause for dissatisfaction with their IIT lives, and this trend stayed true irrespective of demographics, CGPA or outlook towards lives. Where does this expectation to have a better social circle than the one they find themselves in stem from? One course can be better childhood friendships, or the other: the effect of Bollywood movies, specifically the one which glorify college life friendships to the extent that the person who hasn‚Äôt made his 2 lifelong friends feels his college has somehow ‚Äúlet him down‚Äù. At this point, it‚Äôs insightful to see how social circles relate to happiness.
-	116 people reported their friendships to be superficial and highly unreliable. They lacked close friends and their average happiness rated 2.422 out of a 5. Since this average is
~2.8, this number is well below average. It is also interesting to note that only 20 people rated themselves 3+/5 on this scale, establishing a clear connection of happiness and the role of close friends in IIT.
-	Out of 397 people with happiness scores < 3, 63 felt that they had superficial friendships.
-	64 out of these 397 people don‚Äôt have a lot of friends and that makes them insecure, 54 don‚Äôt have a lot of friends but enjoy being alone, 67 have people they can rely on unconditionally
-	Overall, 94 people feel insecure because of friendship. While a lucky 222 can rely unconditionally on their friends, 116 of the respondents conceded their friendships to be superficial/unreliable
-	When comparing friend circle vs satisfaction with IITD, following trends come to light
-	Gender-based take on friend circles:
Females: Most (~43%) of the people happen to be friends with a lot of people but feel close to only a few. In other words, they have many acquaintances (whom they view as friends) but are selective when it comes to making close friends. Roughly 15-20% find it comfortable to rely on their close friends unconditionally whereas just above 10% find their friendships to be ‚Äòtransactional‚Äô and unreliable. Further, about a fifth of the people find themselves alone, out of which a shade over half are comfortable being so while the rest find themselves lonely.
Males: The analysis if similar to their counterparts, the only difference being that the males tend to have a stronger distinction between acquaintances and friends and thus, the no. of people with a lot of friends but few close ones and those with only a few friends, of which all happen to be close tends to be the same.
-	And finally, this is how quality of friendships vary with year of study:
The Student Counselling Stigma
IITs, much like this country, seems to be struggling with a serious mental health crisis. While every tragic incident in IITs is generally followed by instructions to students to seek counselling, what is the state of most of these on-campus counselling services? How comfortable do IIT students feel in approaching these services for help? ‚ÄúThere is a general lack of awareness regarding mental health among those on campus,‚Äù mused a second-year student. ‚Äú In my first year, the counsellors of SCS held mental health workshop, which required compulsory participation. My classmates‚Äô attitude couldn‚Äôt be more cavalier, they started texting because they were bored. No one participated actively,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúPoint is, the administration is trying to provide counselling, but the lack of education regarding mental health results in people shrugging it off as a joke.‚Äù
An interview with a counsellor at the SCS, IIT Delhi, revealed some facts that commanded more immediate concerns. ‚ÄúThe student population is just too large for the confidential and sensitive exercise of one-on-one counselling to be feasible. We would at least try to be present at every hostel to make counselling more approachable to the students, but we just do not have the manpower for that.‚Äù The other problem behind the unapproachability of SCS is its lack of proper integration within the IIT system. ‚ÄúMost students are clueless about how to book an appointment in the SCS. Some don‚Äôt even know where the office is - and can you blame them, the webpages of SCS both on IIT Delhi and BSW website give no information whatsoever about the location, operating hours or how to book an appointment‚Äù wrote another student. The counsellor adds to this topic - ‚ÄúA student once asked me why I never come for the BSW meetings, where important decisions related to mental health are taken. No one ever told me such a thing happens, and on inquiry, I found later that as per BSW constitution, I do have a seat in that meeting.‚Äù Another student writes - ‚ÄúMonthly one-on-one sessions would be an absolute gift but are next to impossible. There are approximately 10000 students, which means around 350 sessions a day. You‚Äôd need like 60 counsellors, just for a measly 45-minute session a month. Now compare it to three counsellors available on campus.‚Äù
We asked in our survey how people view the institute counselling services and how helpful they find it. For the PG students of IIT Delhi, 44.5% of students have never been to the SCS, going to SCS is immaterial since they prefer to deal with their own problems. It‚Äôs up for discussion what this kind of alienation from SCS for more than half the PG population holds for the mental health of PG students in IIT Delhi.
Walking over to the UG side, 32.1% of total responses have never gone to SCS since they have never felt
the need to go. 17.4% prefer dealing with their problems on their own.
Thus we observe 49.5% of the population has had no exposure to the institute services, with 12.4% respondents never having gone to the SCS since they did not consider their problem grave enough. This is significantly different from the 61.7% observed previously on the PG side.
These statistics are alarming since, despite the observed unhappiness and dissatisfaction rates, only 16.1% of total respondents reported actively seeking help related to mental health. By taking in the number of students from each year who answered the survey and taking the percentage of people who sought mental help, it can be seen that as seniority increases, students generally actively seek help for mental help related issues. This can be attributed to the decreased stigma in seeking mental health-related help as seniority increases.
There seems to be a drop in people seeking help in their 4th year of study, which seems to correspond to the lower stress and increased happiness level in 4th year.
Considering 397 respondents who rated themselves below average on the happiness index scale ( < 2.81 / 5), it turns out only 20.7% of them have sought help related to mental health issues. This is merely 1/5th of the total people, which clearly suggests most people aren‚Äôt getting the help they might need.
Only 75 out of these 397 have been to SCS. Only 17 out of these 75 found it helpful.
35 out of 75 said they stopped because they felt it didn‚Äôt help, 34 couldn‚Äôt locate it or get appointments in spite of trying. One person who found it helpful writes: ‚ÄúIt is helpful to a degree. I have no experience with external therapists but SCS seems to do an adequate job, even if they're not spectacular.‚Äù
Analyzing these 397 respondents further reveals that 18 people would rather turn to their family/friends for mental health-related help, rather than consulting professional counselors. 160 said they prefer dealing with mental health issues themselves. 101 have considered going to SCS, 34 of whom decided not to due to negative feedback from their peers, and 80 didn‚Äôt go because they thought their problems weren‚Äôt grave enough.
Institute has also partnered with YourDost to help combat mental health issues on campus. However we might have to rethink its effectiveness, as 189 of the 397 people who rated below average on happiness stated that they have never tried YourDost. 130 have never heard about it. Merely 24 people who‚Äôve tried YourDost prefer it over SCS.
It also turns out more females seek mental health when compared to guys. About 23.8% females reported seeking mental health, a huge increase from guys which stands at 13.7%. However, both numbers are alarmingly low, considering as we saw earlier, 73% people have admitted that their mental well being is affected due to lack of sleep and around 55% people believe that they can increase the happiness in their lives
Around 22% people think they find the timings very restrictive and colliding with the academic schedule of IITD and a similar number of people also think they don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing things with the counsellor due to the fear of being judged.
‚ÄúI would like it to be made absolutely clear as to how much command the SCS has over my life at IIT once I share my problems with them. That is to say, if one were to, hypothetically, tell a counsellor at SCS that he/she were suffering from a grave mental condition (say, suicidal tendencies), what exactly can the SCS do? Ask them to stay at home during the vacations?
Make them stay at home? How far can the SCS influence their lifestyle at IITD, even if they do so with the person's welfare in mind?‚Äù, writes a respondent. This is a very relevant question indeed - we all get told to go seek help as a default response by the administration whenever a tragic event happens that moves the student community due to the sorrowful loss of our own. But what happens when you admit to having suicidal tendencies in SCS?
‚ÄúApparently, there is a fixed protocol for these cases, wherein the student is asked to leave the campus and stay with his parents/local guardians. He can then only visit campus while being accompanied by the said guardian - even for classes and exams‚Äù said a student who wishes not to be named. ‚ÄúIf you visit the campus on your own, even if to meet your friends, a guard will recognise you and call the security control room for you to be escorted away. One can only assume your picture must be circulated internally among the security team. But this can‚Äôt be the sole decision of either the counsellors or the security control office - the final approval must come from a higher authority on this matter.‚Äù Both the SCS counsellor and the security control team confirmed the authenticity of this claim to a varying extent.
Concluding Remarks
Constantly trying to live up to societal and individualistic expectations, IITians have to make great personal and social sacrifices to chase the ‚ÄúIIT Dream‚Äù. After coming here and thrown in a hypercompetitive sphere and forced to excel among the best of the best, most people find
themselves dissatisfied and unhappy. The average happiness level of students per this survey is 2.81/5, indicating that the average student in IITD is moderately unhappy or dissatisfied. The leading cause for this dissatisfaction is the lack of a healthy or close friend circle, followed by academic stress. Academic stress is also the reported reason why the students are sleeping way lesser than the recommended healthy threshold of sleep, which causes them to be less productive and happy. This, in turn, starts affecting their academics adversely and sets up a vicious cycle that the students can only escape when the semester finally ends.
Despite administration doing its bit to provide platforms to combat mental health issues, counselling remains alien to a majority of the students, with people not finding SCS useful or dealing with these issues themselves. A possible positive step in the right direction is
de-stigmatising the idea of mental illnesses in the minds of freshers and striving to create a safe and expressive space where the student feels comfortable to seek help. One small step towards this effect can be to make the SCS more approachable or to integrate it better with the IIT Delhi administration to give it a real say in policies making and implementation.
Ending on a positive note - here is how student happiness compares to their likelihood of helping someone they didn‚Äôt know in times of need (1 being least likely). Clearly, no matter how happy in status quo, IITians seem to have no shortage of empathy for their peers, which maintains steady at ~4 / 5.
Those of us who have been through lows should try and help others out with any small or big steps we can take. It is only possible with a collective channelized effort that we break the mental health stigma and ensure a more productive, less toxic life at IIT Delhi, for the better.

Conflicting Grading Policy Analysis: A look at CGPA in IIT Delhi
BSP
Mar 9, 2024
4 min read
As students embark on their academic journey at the esteemed Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, one key metric becomes a defining milestone in their journey: their CGPA. It starts from the first year, with family and societal pressures along with incentives of department change, possibly pushing students to achieve high CGPAs. As time passes, the objectives include holding PORs, landing internships, or finally getting placed. While it is undeniable that the CGPA serves as a crucial benchmark for academic achievement, a singular emphasis on grades undermines the broader landscape of learning experiences within IITD, perpetuating disparities and hindering opportunities for holistic growth.
In the present scenario, where CGPA plays such a vital role in shaping not just your academic but also your extracurricular life at IIT Delhi and professional life after graduation, it is essential to ensure that the grading system is fair and also matches up to the standards of its counterparts such as other IITs. However, the grading policy at IITD is plagued with systemic issues, with significant discrepancies in average CGPAs across departments and overall lower CGPAs for the entire batch compared to fellow institutes.
The average CGPA across most branches remains notably low even in the fourth year. In many non-circuit branches, attaining a CGPA of 8 is commendable, with even fewer or no students achieving an 8.5 or higher. This disparity is further exacerbated by the variance in grading distributions among branches, with circuital disciplines often witnessing inflated grades compared to their non-circuital counterparts. Within non-circuital branches as well, there is usually significant disparity; for instance, branches like biotechnology, civil and mechanical engineering, witness the lowest average CGPAs, with professors giving 5/6/7s out of ten on average in courses. This subjectivity in awarding different grades on average by professors of other institutions and branches has problematic consequences. It is important to note that institutions providing higher education opportunities and various organizations set absolute CGPA requirements, which, due to this grading subjectivity, cannot compare the academic capabilities of two students from different branches or institutions.

Batch of 2019:

Average CGPA
Biochemical Engineering & Biotechnology
7.12
Civil Engineering
7.36
Engineering Physics
7.9
Electrical Engineering
8.32
The imposition of an arbitrary CGPA threshold, such as the 8.5 CGPA criteria for research opportunities, government scholarships, and internships/placements, with averages being around 6.5 on a scale of 10 for most non-circuital branches, effectively sidelines deserving candidates, spreading dissatisfaction among students (8.5 CGPA is a requirement for getting the merit award, with multiple branches not having anyone fulfilling that criterion even though being in the top 7%). This discrepancy not only undermines the comparability of CGPA across disciplines but also poses a significant barrier for students aspiring to pursue further studies or secure internships.
Moreover, the competitive landscape extends beyond the confines of IIT's campus. The proliferation of tier 2-3 colleges boasting substantial exposure and opportunities underscores the diminishing currency of the IIT tag alone. Other top IITs also differ severely in grading, many having much higher average CGPAs (please refer to the table below). In such a scenario, where grades wield a disproportionate influence in shaping prospects, overemphasizing CGPA as a determinant of success becomes increasingly problematic.

Yet, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of CGPA as a metric for academic performance and, thus, the need for reform CGPA should provide a standardized measure that evaluates students' mastery of course contents and ability to apply theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, CGPA is pivotal in screening candidates for higher education programs and internships, serving as a crucial filter in the competitive selection process. Thus, while CGPA may not encapsulate a student's learning journey, it remains a valuable tool for assessing academic proficiency.
Addressing the systemic challenges surrounding CGPA requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, there is a pressing need to standardize grading distributions across disciplines, ensuring fairness and comparability in academic assessments. This entails collaborative efforts between departments and colleges to recalibrate grading practices and mitigate the disparities that undermine the credibility of CGPA, ensuring fairness and comparability in academic assessments.
Fostering a holistic development culture is essential in redefining success beyond numerical metrics. This involves recognizing and valuing experiential learning, research endeavors, and extracurricular pursuits that transcend the confines of CGPA-centric evaluations. By providing avenues for students to engage in interdisciplinary projects, collaborative research, and real-world applications of their knowledge, IITD can nurture a culture of innovation and holistic growth that transcends the limitations of numerical metrics.
Furthermore, addressing the antiquated course curriculum prevalent in many branches is paramount in enhancing the relevance of CGPA. Specific courses and components of the curriculum do not align with the evolving needs of the industry or contribute to students' learning curve. For example, given the lack of infrastructure in some undergraduate laboratories on campus, some laboratory courses in various departments are rendered irrelevant. These courses must be more successful in providing meaningful, practical experiences and improving learning amongst students, burdening students and undermining their interest in the field.
In the pursuit of academic excellence, it's undeniable that IITD represents the pinnacle of rigor and intellectual challenge. However, it's disheartening to witness students, despite hailing from the best college in the country, facing setbacks and missed opportunities due to the stringent grading system and intense academic pressure. While the prestige of IITD is synonymous with its rigorous standards, if this rigor ultimately results in disillusionment and dissatisfaction among students, one must ponder: Is the maintenance of such rigor by the college genuinely worth it?

Feb 15, 2021
Three (honest) students come together to dispense their ingenious takes on cheating in examinations. Precedent dictates that their identities be concealed, lest they receive undue attention for not tricking the system.
A
: In my mind, cheating is a slippery slope from doing it once to doing it for every minor, major and quiz. Now, why's that bad? I would have to put that down to a combination of a fear that I'd eventually get caught. The first part is just down to the idea that the chance of getting away with it once is much higher than consistently getting away with it. It takes one slip up, and then my fate is down to how much sympathy a third party feels for me, I won‚Äôt like to be in such a situation.
B
: I was not an honest person in my childhood. I used to indulge in rampant cheating till 8th Std employing many innovative tricks in the process. In the 9th Std, I stumbled upon the question of the morality of cheating. It was because of some spiritual influence, as I had converted from an Atheist to a Theist. With passing time, as I reflected upon the morality of cheating, I started understanding the real truth not to cheat. I am still in the process to understand it better.
C
: It‚Äôs mostly because of the fear of getting caught and not moral ethics. I know people who have faced the consequences of cheating in exams and advise against it. I probably would resort to copying as well in the absence of such rules. I wouldn‚Äôt say that everyone feels this way as most people I know are pretty comfortable cheating.
B
: My past two years of experience in IIT taught me that there must be some adulteration of marks-based learning in the learning process in such a competitive environment where both grades and understanding are necessary. For the exceptional like me, who wants to pursue research, such marks based adulteration should be of minimal proportion. I balance my mindset towards the subject with 80% focus on learning and 20% on grades.
A
: In addition to learning, examinations contribute to understanding the course material a bit better. I would have missed an exciting aspect of the course that lends itself to real-world applications. Of course, this is because I want to figure out a couple of new things, and so far, I've felt a lot of courses have done this. However, all the above walks the line between moral perspective and the likelihood of (long term) negative outcomes. Cheating can have tangible benefits very quickly.
C:
We don‚Äôt have the freedom to choose courses or professors solely based on our interest and every semester, most of our courses will be the ones recommended to us. So it essentially boils down to just ‚Äúgetting through‚Äù the course with a decent grade.
B
: There were experiences where mass cheating has hampered my grades in courses. In the first 1-2 hours after the marks‚Äô release, I get into the ranting mode about cheaters. They are the reason due to which the average is skyrocketing. I won‚Äôt diplomatically say that there is no sense of hatred towards the cheater. I hate them in the initial hours of marks release. After some time, it all cools down, and I go in a reflective mode where I blame myself for not studying at par. You can‚Äôt always blame someone else for your failures. Such instances of mass cheating instigated a feeling to cheat, but I believe that ‚ÄòDuniya Gol hai‚Äô. Thus, Good habits, Bad habits, everything will normalise at the end. I cope with the stress using such perspectives and encourage myself to look forward to the long run instead of pitying these irrelevant things. Having a superior complexity over the cheaters also motivates me to not indulge in it. By not plagiarising, I am pretty well aware that I have a potential which those people combined couldn‚Äôt conjure up.
A
: Getting low grades due to soaring averages is disappointing. It is hard to tell why the average is high and predict the real extent of cheating in any given course. Given that, it's a bit of a cop-out to say I only did poorly because others were cheating, not because I was poorly prepared too. When cheating is a reality, blaming my low grades on cheating is blaming the circumstances. It doesn't really change how I think about the cost-benefit of cheating because a low grade is not as high a cost as a DISCO for me.
B
: When exams are conducted remotely, it‚Äôs only natural that most of the students will resort to cheating. If anyone is at fault, it‚Äôs probably the professors who can get careless at times with the test format
. It‚Äôs like Pam says in
The office
, ‚ÄúWhen a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, you don't blame the child; he didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, ‚ÄòDrive, kid; I trust you.‚Äô‚Äù
A:
But
I don't feel any ill will towards those who cheat and get away with it. Perhaps, it comes from a privileged position that a couple of low grades don't mean too much to me. Not everyone finds their courses super interesting, and there that grade is more important than learning some esoteric idea taught in the course. I think it's merely a question of our priorities today and how they differ. Competing with each other, I would support stricter rules to curb cheating, only because it allows me to get grades easier.
B:
‚ÄòIgnorance is Bliss‚Äô; all the cheaters are in this bubble of ignorance. It blinds them to see the cons of cheating in the long run. Some cheaters are aware of such bubbles; unfortunately, they lack the ‚Äòcommon support‚Äô to get out of it.  My message for the students who plagiarise in exams is- Imagine yourself sitting in an interview where you are eligible for an excellent CTC. For some inexplicable and unfair reasons, the Company offers you a mediocre job. What goes around comes around.
C:
I don‚Äôt think anyone thinks any less of the people who cheat. An online semester comes with its demerits, this being one of them. I feel that a lot more could be done to ensure fairness in exams. We all agree that there are more secure (and less secure) ways of conducting a test, then why not have an institute-wide policy on testing? We already do this for attendance and audit criterion. I think it‚Äôs much ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to do the syllabus bit by bit than it is to come up with ways to fool the system. In my opinion, the best way to deal with academics is by attending lectures regularly and moving at the same pace as the class. The other approach involves all-nighters, begging for assignments, worrying about proctoring and being a lot more stressful.

I cheat because I have to
Anonymous

The cause and the effect
I gave my second semester honestly, abiding by the rules drawn by the college. I scored low grades. The class average had gone high, as many students were cheating. At that point, I asked myself a question, "Why didn't I cheat?". Eventually, I started cheating in my (third) semester tests, and I started scoring good marks.
I think the people who don't cheat are at a loss as the quiz patterns are overwhelming. We are expected to solve ten numerical questions within ten minutes in a quiz. This is really very tough if we are doing it alone. It can be said that because of these strict and terrible quiz policies, the students are forced to cheat. The faculties are not concerned if there is heavy rain or a network issue. The submissions are delayed by a few minutes due to network hiccups. This leads to a deduction of 2 to 5 marks which breaks down the morale of students. Sitting in front of a laptop, the entire day is really very difficult. We face backaches, headaches, fatigue and many such other problems. There are times when your family needs you, but you can't help them because of strict deadlines. These things too, unfortunately, instigate me to use the easy way up.
Not studying yourself and completely relying on cheating is not the right way to score good marks. The drill is to study your part and make good friends. Professors give huge syllabus and set lengthy papers by providing very less time. So we divided the syllabus, and that helped me a lot. And I completely understand the risk of being met with a DISCO, but if you have a trustworthy group of friends, you can surely make it happen!
Grades, Knowledge & Offline Semester
Indeed, knowledge matters more than grades, but most of the college life factors have, unfortunately, "CG Boundaries". I prioritise many facets of my college life, along with studies. It seems tough for me to imagine myself just studying in college. My college expectations are a holistic development where academics play a major role, but not all of it. As compared to online semesters, there is a fragile possibility of cheating in the offline semester. But as all the students are sailing in the same ship, the class average won't shoot up. Thus there wouldn't be any need to cheat. These thoughts crossed my mind too. How will I study when the semester resumes in offline mode? How will I give my exams without cheating? As I have given my exams solely on my merit before this pandemic, I am confident that I would be able to do the same once the college resumes.
My parents have asked me a few times regarding what is the use of cheating? I told them that I wouldn't cheat if there is no need to cheat.

Gender and Genz: Equity Hiring - Op Ed
Maitreya Wagh and Mallika Singla
Nov 26, 2020
13 min read
Updated:
Feb 17, 2021
Maitreya:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre used to winning, but so is everyone else around us.‚Äù
I‚Äôll never forget the introductory statement given by Prof. Amitabha Tripati in our first lecture at IIT Delhi. The statement is true. When we try for something, we generally get it, whether it would be topping 4th grade, getting a good rank at SOF Olympiads, and obviously, getting into IIT. I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre lucky, there‚Äôs a mountain of hard work and passionate commitment behind our achievements, but until we get our first ‚Äúchaugi‚Äù, or our first loss in poltu, we‚Äôre not used to seeing a plethora of commitment gone to waste. And obviously, the ‚Äúchaugi‚Äù was because of the professor, and the poltu loss was because ‚Äúdusra candidate seniors ke saath phoonkta hai.‚Äù And while poor grades and Election losses can often be compensated for, failing to secure internships and jobs, arguably the biggest thing that puts IITs apart, are slightly tougher to digest. And of course, even here, there has to be a reason why we fail. And of course, that reason is that these companies have approached hiring with a specific bias in their mind.
The topic of the reservation is always the elephant in the room at IIT. In a Humanities course I recently studied, our professor asked us to speak out about reservation. After 5 minutes of pin-drop silence, one student braved herself to speak out her views. What followed was 55 minutes of intense discussion both supporting and against reservation.
Personally, while I see the need and benefits of reservation, I believe it is unfair to those who aren‚Äôt benefiting from it. When you are taught that the world is a rat race, your reaction to all problems is to try and be the best, because you know that the best will win the race. So, in a race to secure the prestigious day 1 internship, you know that objectively the best CVs get shortlisted, and the one who‚Äôs code passes maximum test cases should get selected. When you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs natural to feel sad and resentful at the process.
Now, does a preference exist when companies come for training and placements? I personally believe it exists in some companies, not in others. I can think of 2 reasons why this preference exists -
Mismatched Supply
-
Demand
. As is the case in any market, as the supply increases, the tougher it is for each product to be sold. The reason it‚Äôs tougher for engineers to get into IIMs isn‚Äôt because IIMs do not like engineers, it‚Äôs simply because the number of engineers applying for IIMs is too much. The supply of male students for internships/jobs is around 90% while that of female students is 10%. May it be for diversity or any other reason, even if a company wants at least 25% females (let alone 50-50), there will be a need for some preference in hiring (assuming that the average talent of males and females is equal). Now ideally, after the sex ratio of IIT improves, this preference should cease to exist. Why is the sex ratio so bad? Let‚Äôs come to our 2nd point.
Upliftment
- Even if there is a preference in hiring, according to my experience, core and advisory fields are male-dominated. And as I do not believe that males are inherently more adept in these fields, the only reason for this dominance is the society and in general, the excessive struggles that females do still face. While I won‚Äôt go deeply into this, it would be foolish for us to notice that even while it might be equally easy for females to fill in their CVs (also arguable considering the low ratio of females occupying top tier PORs), there are a plethora of struggles that are still being faced - right from preferences being shown through the family, to casual sexism and objectification faced in the society and also while in IIT.
Even with these reasons, from a male perspective, these are the issues I see in the process and the outcomes of hiring today -
Expectations
‚â†
Reality.
Imagine us not knowing that reservation exists in IITs. Let‚Äôs say you get an AIR of 8000. Knowing that IITs have 10000 seats, you are overjoyed, you think you‚Äôve aced JEE Advanced and you‚Äôre happy. Suddenly, you realize that only 5000 of these seats were open for you. This is where resentment kicks in more, this is where the anger comes. A counter to this may be that this confirms the complaints of a bias. Well, I‚Äôd say that you don‚Äôt feel bad about your achievement until someone devalues it. If an award is being given to one female and one male student, it‚Äôs not going to leave anyone dejected and feeling betrayed by the system. And when no one is dejected, no one is going to call out on an achievement. Transparency is something which is important and should be there, in order to readjust expectations, which could affect overall planning towards internships/alternatives as well.
Cascading effect of Interns on Placements.
Now let‚Äôs accept that there is a need for giving preferences to uplift a section of the society which is facing greater struggles. The first preference is given during selection in IITs through JEE Advanced. Then during training, this preference is given again. Now, these students who have already been given this preference and now have the best college and the best firms on their CV, are once again given this push while sitting for placements. This cascading effect creates an aura of an additional platform which may not be needed in the first place. Now, the male population does not receive these platforms. And while our lives may be easier and our struggles easier to overcome, the struggle of landing a top internship/job gets tougher and tougher as our direct competitors are given this platform. And one something you want keeps drifting out of reach for no fault of your own, it is natural to feel cheated by the system.
Even if we understand the reasons and the problems surrounding this process, we still arrive at a mess. Because no one can answer the question - What do we do about this?
Well, asking transparency from companies in their procedures for hiring could be a good start. But at the end of the day, the only way any issue of reservation is solved is when the given platform is removed. And the only correct time to remove this platform is when there is no need for this platform any more.
Statements like ‚ÄúHRs are tharki‚Äù or ‚Äúgirls should raise their voice against this preference‚Äù aren‚Äôt helping. An interviewer is not sitting on the other side of the table wanting to be seduced by a 20 years old interviewee. Trying to state your point by sexualising this process is the easiest thing to do, but also the most pointless. Objectifying the decisions made by companies won‚Äôt ever get them listening to you, as all objectification does is it dismisses the underlying point as one coming from a sexist, misogynistic person, and given the amount of objectification already existing in the world, no one can be blamed for avoiding conversations which are unnecessarily inserting it. And of course, in this rat race, no one is going to resist a gentle push on the way to the finish line. Expecting that is like expecting every rich person to give up their riches.
We‚Äôre all taught to run away from a place that seems unsafe. If you want someone to hear your complaints and someone to engage in a discussion, let‚Äôs create a space free from judgement and devaluation. Because in the end, we all want to finish the same race, you‚Äôll slip too if you try to sabotage the tracks.
Mallika:
‚ÄúYaar tu ladki hai, teri toh job/ intern lag hi jayegi‚Äú
‚Äì sounds familiar right? Before your preconceived notion of how this-will-just-be-some-feminist-rant kicks in and you stop reading further, let me quickly clarify ‚Äì I‚Äôll try and make it as logical as possible.
It is a well-known fact that female representation in the workforce is abysmally low - a trend easily evident in the corporate world as well. Lack of female role models, pay-gap debates are very much real. When this situation is analyzed from the corporate lens, improving the sex ratio makes sense and this often takes up the form of targeted recruitment. Corporates also leverage the positive impact of diverse perspectives at the workplace and a more inclusive reputation highlighted as part of their social responsibility. Thus, the corporates usually have a strong logical backing whenever they come to campus with a seemingly ‚Äòfemale-preference‚Äô outlook.
This corporate trend then percolates down to a campus-like IITD. Due to a low sex ratio, when corporates come with an agenda of meeting their internal targets, it‚Äôs absolutely likely that the statistics favour women candidates over their male counterparts. While I agree that women get a preference, I still don‚Äôt see how around 100 women can be held responsible for reducing the chances of the 700 male candidates. In fact, out of these 100, at least 15-20 (if not more) would be as suited as their male counterparts as a sole result of the profiles they have built. Additionally, one very often overlooks the fact that there are multiple societal challenges that most women still go through before and after becoming a part of the IITD community ‚Äì familial prejudices against sending women for pursuing streams/ careers viewed as male-centric for starters.
If we now look at the male community - it is not unreasonable for them to resent female counterparts that got a preference over them. Seeing someone get an advantage despite their resume/ experience not being as great as your own can be frustrating. But having said that, it is important to realize that indulging in belittling women and their achievements, spreading narratives/ content that targets women as well as passing sexist statements is also not justified. While I agree that recruitment might not be unbiased, I very strongly feel that narratives that discredit women and their efforts are so overdone that more often than not, they are narratives that act as an excuse to justify one‚Äôs own failure.
This ‚Äòpsychological conditioning‚Äô further manifests as a detrimental challenge in the female community. When women are repeatedly told that all their accomplishments are primarily credited to them being females, it acts as a severe blow to a women‚Äôs self-confidence and her ability to trust herself to perform well only based on her skillset. The so-called ‚Äòplacement/ intern meme‚Äô groups don‚Äôt help the situation either. Hearing your worth being de-valued by your own peer group ‚Äì by both men and women these days ‚Äì merely cements your conditioning.
It is thus a complex social situation, where every stakeholder is trying to adjust, realign and find the best solution. We may have not found the best solution yet, but it still does not give anyone the freeway to act detrimentally towards a social segment.
Some Intriguing Questions
Q) Girls in IIT come from a much greater level of privilege than the girl child the reservation policy hopes to help. This brings into question the merit of giving them reservation even though they, by and large, have come from a setting at par with the boys in terms of facilities available for training. Don‚Äôt you think preferential hiring from IITs then serves only the companies - as they get to
look woke
with their diversity figures?
Maitreya:
All reservations help those who are already privileged most in that reserved category. Caste-based reservation is also most beneficial to high income families, who‚Äôs children also have had access to similar facilities as those of the general caste. This doesn‚Äôt mean there is no benefit to it. Two benefits I see are
More girls in IIT means more top engineers, leading to more role models for a young girl to look up to.
A major issue (even in high income families) is the small internal bias some parents could have towards boys. Basically, if they have 2 children, they are more likely to send the boy to coaching classes for JEE rather than the girl, based on the precedence that engineering is a male dominated field. I have personally seen more parents willing to opt for JEE coaching for their daughter given that it now has become slightly easier to get into a top college.
Mallika:
While most girls in IIT come from a privileged background, there are also those that come from less privileged communities. However, the merit of giving reservation gets diluted when it is leveraged by the privileged community. Preferential hiring does help some of the under-privileged, but I agree to the fact that in its current form, the system is mainly serving the companies.
Q) It‚Äôs been acknowledged in both articles that companies prefer hiring women for social responsibility brownie points. Don‚Äôt you think that encouraging this kind of corporate culture is unethical and unfair, because it devalues both the female candidate who got chosen as well as the male candidate who didn‚Äôt ?
Maitreya:
No. It doesn‚Äôt devalue. Posts on social media about the process devalue the candidate. Certain awards are specifically given to two people, a boy and a girl. No one feels bad when they win an award and when a girl wins the award.
A company can come with 10 offers, saying 4 are for females. The only thing that can/should be criticized is the company‚Äôs metric, and not the aptitude of the candidates who got placed there.
Mallika:
I agree that this concept is unfair and does devalue skills of selected women and rejected men. Yet, from a practicality and convenience perspective, corporates will always prefer to earn the brownie points than attempting to create an ideal world.
Q) Getting rejected only because of his gender might take a toll on the guy‚Äôs mental health and confidence. Shouldn‚Äôt companies straight out just ask boys to not even compete for jobs with preferential hiring ?
Maitreya:
No. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs impossible to get into these firms. The number of boys in most firms are significantly more than the number of girls. But yes, it has now become tougher for boys to get a job at firms which have preferential hiring and I believe they should be aware of this. (Not even sure why companies which take 50% girls and 50% boys should tell boys not to compete only. Defeats the purpose)
Mallika:
Repercussions on mental health and confidence would be true in case of any rejection. I feel that preferential hiring is only part of the problem, and rejections cannot be credited solely to the same. While there would be cases where this might be the key reason, but if we look at the bigger picture, 100 women cannot be held responsible for 700 rejections. For the few who actually lose jobs due to preferential hiring, I agree that the situation is unfair and unfortunate.
Q) Would you prefer a system of placements where the CV does not show the candidate's name, caste and gender ? and Why ?
Maitreiya:
Tough to answer. I think this depends on the firm‚Äôs selection criteria. If a firm is coming on campus and saying they will be fair and they have no preference in hiring, then yes, a CV without identity could be implemented. If a firm comes with certain preferences in mind (which is totally fine for a firm to want this), then this obviously won't serve the purpose
Malika:
Yes, that would be an ideal situation where all candidates are shortlisted only based on their credentials and not based on their gender, caste, etc.
Q) Since we‚Äôre doing so much to improve women participation in STEM fields and fight patriarchy, shouldn‚Äôt we also incentivize men for jobs like modelling, nursing etc that have traditionally been female dominated?
Maitreya:
Sure, incentivize, but this isn‚Äôt even the point. STEM jobs are rapidly increasing in demand because of higher salaries and rise to occupy high positions in top firms. If you feel there is a similar demand for modeling and nursing, boys are not given the opportunity to apply for these, sure, incentivise.
Mallika:
I completely agree with this and feel that the presence of men in fields like nursing should be normalized. The idea of certain professions being dominated by one gender stems from the socially accepted gender norms ‚Äì a concept that I completely disagree with.
Q) Isn't preferential hiring equivalent to hiring people based on their gender ? The very definition of sexism.   People don‚Äôt fight for women to go into male dominated fields where the work is tough - like coal mines or construction sites. The hard work required to get a high paying STEM job is similar. The amount of women in IITs and STEM jobs have increased in the past couple of years not because society has changed but because women have realized it's so much easier for them to get in. Is the aim of the movement to include more women or just make their lives easier?
Maitreya:
Can be said for any movement. Then Black Lives Matter is racist because you are talking only about one gender. I don‚Äôt believe there is an inherent trait within males and females that since birth, only males have the aptitude for STEM jobs. Given this, the only reason why STEM jobs are male dominated is only because of society and precedence of the same. Also, I do not believe because companies are pushing to take in more females, it suddenly has become so much easier to get into these jobs.
Mallika:
Firstly, in the status quo, most fields are male dominated. A coal mine or construction site would be an extreme end of the spectrum which will also be achieved once the presence of women in places like factories and even offices is normalized.
Secondly, I agree that women are offered more opportunities, yet I believe that in order to encourage more women to join the workforce, a support system is essential. Making one aspect of life easier does not mean putting women‚Äôs lives at par with men ‚Äì we might not like it, but the burden of societal discrimination is still very much prevalent at homes, offices, etc.
Q) Naming the extra seats supernumerary doesn't make it "Fair". There is still some boy out there with a rank of 10000 paying for the mistakes of the older generation. Views?
Maitreya:
Yes, reservation is not fair for those who are disadvantaged by it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs only for mistake of older generations, because even now, there is discrimination that happens on caste and gender and there is a certain pedestal with boys get. Male dominance in engineering colleges and jobs will continue if there is 0 reservation, and direct reservation makes it tougher to get good colleges at ranks at which it was earlier possible. Supernumerary tries to meet both in the middle
Mallika:
I am not sure if we can call supernumerary reservation ‚Äòunfair‚Äô ‚Äì it is a solution for a very different problem, that is, promoting women in STEM. As far as, ‚Äòpaying for mistakes of older generations‚Äô is concerned, I think this is a utopian thought which somehow makes one feel that in the status quo women have an equal social position which is far from the truth. We live in a country where women still cover their heads in front of elders, marital rape is common and talking about menstruation is a taboo.
Q) Men are expected to stand against child marriages, exploitation and other forms of inequalities. But when we ask women to support men and get equality, why are we suddenly termed
misogynistic
and
sexist
?
Maitreya:
I agree with this. Preferential hiring is affecting men and when men are vocal about it, it is incorrect for the statements to be slammed by calling them sexist and misogynistic. There should be an understanding across both genders about these issues. Given that, calling companies ‚Äútharki‚Äù and talking about ‚ÄúCQ‚Äù isn‚Äôt helping your case. These terms are derogatory and will rightfully be called out. But yes, preferential hiring is making it tougher for men to get into jobs and this should be acknowledged by everyone.
Mallika:
I completely disagree with the fact that women do not support men in getting equality. The true essence of the feminist movement is to support equality between both the genders. Over time, this concept has diluted and has led to the degradation of the movement ‚Äì and I personally do not support preferential treatment. For example, I do not see why women should be given a separate coach and reserved seats in the Delhi Metro.

Reconsidering Academic Coercion
An issue that I am unable to reconcile with is the distinct lack of interaction between students and the academic section at IITD. Something is amiss and whatever it is, it has resulted in a curtailment of academic freedom and overall quality of life for undergraduate students at IITD. Allow me to build a case.
Last semester, students from three core-engineering disciplines were prevented from registering for the Data Structures courses floated by the Department of Computer Science. The reason? It was clashing with a core course. This has been the case since a lot of years and up till now, students interested in taking up DS chose to drop their core course and complete it in a later semester. But this year, they were prevented from doing so.
Let us first look at the professor's side. Professors would want students to not undermine their core degree by dropping a core course in favour of another unrelated course and would want the student to get exposed fully to what their branch has to offer. Fair enough. From the student‚Äôs perspective, the course is important to students who wish to or who are simply compelled to pursue their career path in a non-core setting, because who will tell professors that while there are 25-30 companies that visit for non-core roles during the internship season, there are only 4-5 companies who recruit for core roles? (keeping in mind the value of internships in the prevailing success matrix).
There were many solutions to this issue (changing the slotting to enable students to do both courses, adjusting course requirements etc.), but the easiest one was to prevent students from registering for the course, and that is exactly how the problem was dealt with. The net effect thus was that students were forced to forego a course that could have helped them with their internship preparations. I do not wish to get into the impact on students who may have wished to pursue their internships in the area, but would instead like to focus on why is there such a lasting mismatch of views between student reality and reality as perceived by professors?
I have personally had interactions with many professors and many of my colleagues have even raised issues regarding problematic rules at departmental meetings and although there is agreement that things have to be changed, nothing ever happens and year after year students are found at the receiving end of the same policies. Take for example the particularly confused policies of the Dept. of Chemical Engineering:
Each year, Dual Degree students are penalized by two-grades if they do not stay back on campus during the 4th year summer holidays to pursue their MTP
For DD students, the only time that majority of the companies offer internships is the 4th year, and penalizing students for wanting to get real-life experience is foolhardy. Even more so when you consider that the Computer Science Department does not penalize DD students for the same and instead provides alternatives through which the summer component can be completed at a later date.
Students are not given internship credits for a non-core internship
How many opportunities for core internships does the department/OCS provide anyway?
I do not deny that professors have the students' best interests in mind. From their perspective, it is important that students do not undermine the essence of their branch in any way. But there is essentially a gap in terms of understanding the reality as perceived by students and a lack of motivation to work on how things can be made better.
So where is the issue? There can only be one of two causes:
Inertia on the side of the departments and administration
A very weak student body
I think it is both. It is not as if there is a forum or vehicle for the administration to listen directly to student issues. The onus is on departmental convenors to speak up for themselves and their batchmates. However, even when they do speak up about genuine issues, they are never listened to nor given a straight answer. There is a trust deficit between most professors and students and the possibility that there might be an actual problem is never considered. When students look to break free from this and direct their problems to higher authorities, they are told that the department/someone else is responsible for addressing their concern. So it is clear that no one is serious about addressing these issues. I speak as a student who has spent four years in the system.
It is obvious to everyone that things have to be changed, but it is frustrating to see how no one is really looking at reality and actually working towards solving these problems. It is thus difficult to expect any actual change. The only hope is perhaps one day, one of us will occupy the chairs and will perhaps look at students in a more forgiving manner. But I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it.

An appeal to stop
normalizing
mental distress in students
I was speaking to a friend the other day who was struggling with her doctoral thesis. She was worried about the importance of what she‚Äôs doing, where it might take her, why she wasn‚Äôt being as productive as she just knew she could be, all in the midst of pressing family issues that were further undermining her faith in herself and her work. I found myself remembering and sharing how I too had, through the seven years of my doctoral program, struggled with near-daily anxiety and periods of intense depression, where it felt to me as though nothing would ever be alright again. I was certain that my prospects were bleak, a significant part of my young life had been wasted in the pursuit of nothing important and that it might have been better if I had chosen pretty much anything else to do with my life - something that did not make my question myself so much. I often found myself paralyzed, unable to focus, read, write or engage with my work.
Moments of confidence, though infrequent, presented themselves here and there. Buoying on them, and the support of a loving family (I was - am - lucky to have that), I was able to eventually see my work through to the end. More importantly, I was able to realize, for better or for worse, that I had to pick myself up and ‚Äújust do‚Äù. I realized also, ironically, that though I was surrounded by accomplished academics, there was not a single empathetic voice that could help make me feel soothed emotionally, or guide me practically. Each time I did try and reach out, it was brushed aside. ‚Äúwe‚Äôve all been through this‚Äù, I was told. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a part of the process.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal.‚Äù It never helped me to hear this. Not once.
It dawned upon me that there were some deeply disturbing flaws in our system that rejected the notion of a student‚Äôs mental health, while steadily contributing to its worsening. It was a silent, invisible toxicity that seemed to be woven into the fabric of the system.
A quick search on the internet will tell you that graduate students are the most depressed academic group in the world. Another search will tell you how the Indian youth - our academia focused youth - has ranked the highest in the world on scales of depression and suicide indices. We have normalized the struggles and high intensity stress that students on all levels feel they must go through to ‚Äúfeel successful‚Äù. It has become an ordinary part of the process to want to pull one‚Äôs hair out, to want to quit, run away, or harm oneself. Our academic world seems to espouse an ‚Äúunnatural selection‚Äù where survival - and thus success - are equated with withstanding immense stress. The others are dismissed as weak or mentally unfit. The more that is overcome, the higher the feeling of worth and the shinier the imaginary badge of honor.
The system itself is so shiny and alluring - so full of promises of providing the best education, the best pathways to a glamorous future and the highest ‚Äúego boost‚Äù both for us and our families - that it took me a while to realize how it indoctrinates you with the same toxic principles that promise the same convoluted experience of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. I went through my seven years, always toiling, always waiting for this elusive feeling of success, but never once experiencing it.
This is perhaps why, though I write against this very meaning of success, a small part of me continues to blame myself for never knowing it; I remain certain that I did not do enough
.
When I shared this with my friend, she expressed what seemed like genuine surprise at my struggles with self-confidence, anxiety and clinical depression. She remarked, ‚Äúbut you seemed so self-assured and put-together!‚Äù ‚ÄúSo did you,‚Äù I said softly.
After thinking about this further, what I can say with reasonable confidence is that I am not the only student who labored under this delusion. No matter whether we are studying at an undergraduate or postgraduate level, whether we belong to the humanities or the sciences, we each make bold attempts to walk with our heads held high in faux-confidence, ready to ‚Äúwin‚Äù, no matter what our inner turmoil. Sharing this turmoil might mean admitting weakness. And sometimes we don‚Äôt share because we don‚Äôt know who will listen ‚Äì truly listen. All this entire setup does is make the others believe that we‚Äôre absolutely fine.
And so, we each battle on alone, while struggling similarly and simultaneously
.
The student‚Äôs task is to learn, grow, find herself, create, innovate, learn to lead. Instead, within this system, we fall into the spiral of fighting for one mark; half a mark even, to attend all the classes and then some, then join extra-curricular engagements, have a social life, homework, lab work, internships. And amid all of this, we have the usual but necessary concerns of youth. We might worry about our futures, our careers, or our families who might be depending on us to excel, earn money and so on. We might - and perhaps must - be excited and nervous about experiencing love, maybe a life away from home where we can make our own rules, establish lifelong friendships and challenge ourselves professionally and personally to test and prove our mettle. We might also be worried about difficult personal or familial situations.
As we - and the entire system - reify this meaning of what it means to be a student, we lose other ways of being, other ways of learning and teaching, other ways of feeling and being successful or productive.
The focus is so myopic, that we often lose our place in the powerful collective we have the potential to form as students, with each other and with our professors.
Professors and staff, mired by their own pressures, reinforce this system too. Everyone forgets that students are more than students, and that even our professors and administrative staff must have their own difficulties. No doubt, on campus, these roles are paramount, but I do wonder if there is a way to create pockets of compassion, while still fostering, say, healthy competition? Can students be allowed to experience the highs of success while learning to ground themselves in humility, and learn to treat failure with kindness so that they may try again? Can we each learn to listen to our friends when they‚Äôre struggling with as little judgment as possible, and receive the same compassion in return? I would be very surprised, and will challenge it with confidence, if someone were to claim that they never felt the need to talk about their struggles. I will say with equal certainty that many would have tried and received unhelpful platitudes in return: brush it off, move on, this stuff happens.
It is in our basic humanity to connect with others. A disconnect from those we love, cherish and feel safe with is at the root of much of our emotional distress. No, our institution does not have to fulfill all our needs for emotional security. Some of it will come from family, and some from our own efforts to make good friends and partners. Some of it will come from systemic changes, some of which we ourselves will have to initiate, like raising our voices against that which violates our sense of peace or hurts our ability to persevere. A lot of it will come from our ability to approach the person who hasn‚Äôt left their hostel room for a long time, or who performed poorly on a test, and gently ask them if they‚Äôd like to talk about it, or have a cup of tea with them in silent solidarity.
Some support should certainly come from the administration. This can be through service provision such as a student counseling center which houses several trained psychotherapists as well as psychiatrists, where anyone (even teachers and staff!) can walk-in for some therapeutic support in a safe, confidential manner. The professionals at the center must make efforts to make themselves visible, available and approachable, and involve themselves deeply in the lives of the students such that they may be experienced as a relevant and reliable source of support. This center must not exist just because someone raised a flag about its absence, but rather whose presence and facilities must indicate the institution‚Äôs commitment to the mental well-being of everyone on campus. It must be equipped to provide students support when they feel alone, low, unsafe, confused, heart-broken, humiliated, bullied, teased, and worried.
Further, this commitment to the well-being of students should reflect in taking larger steps such as creating a consistent calendar of professional seminars or workshops that teach us how to bolster our mental health or in intimate efforts such as a high-ranking officer checking up personally on a student who may have shared a difficulty in her home. This commitment is also reflected in allowing students and faculty to take a ‚Äúmental health day‚Äù when they feel the need to reset, no questions asked. It is found in teaming up with qualified mental health professionals of various kinds to make space in their schedules to provide therapy to students at costs subsidized by the institute. It could even be found in creating a fund dedicated to achieving these and other ideas. In essence, an institute can be said to be committed to the well being of its students when it makes an active effort to bolster the resilience of each student, provides support when they feel overwhelmed and takes responsibility to ensure that there are services and resources to cater to those needs. This will allow students to work hard, achieve, innovate, lead and create internal and external resources that will last for life, without sacrificing the feeling of emotional wellness. While we will all still definitely feel horribly stressed or anxious, say, before exams, or before placements and so on, this is only acceptable and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when it is short-lived, and the student can cope, whether by her own resources, institutional support or a combination of the two.
I feel compelled to add that prioritizing mental health, kindness and compassion does not indicate a compromise in the pursuit of excellence. It is simply a shift in perspective, a different pathway of getting there that does not normalize ‚Äì and certainly does not valorize ‚Äì unbearable anxiety, sadness, worry and stress as an acceptable part of the process. There is no rulebook that says competition may only exist without compassion, or that one will never succeed unless they have been the most anxious they could ever be, and that they may only thrive once they have been broken down. These are not rites of passage and surviving them does not merit badges of honor. I appeal to the institution to stop normalizing and glorifying such struggles for students and for professors. Those who have experienced say, depression and anxiety or any form of severe mental distress will tell you that their success (however they define it) has nothing to do with these trials by fire.
They will have succeeded in spite of these obstacles, not because of them
.
I appeal also to students to not wait for a systemic change. Take it upon yourself to learn how to increase your own mental health quotient and that of those around you. You can go large (say, organize a day of awareness or learn skills to cope with stress) or act on a more intimate level, (say, learn the skill of listening to others with kindness, or learn how to spot the signs of mental distress in oneself and others.)
We and the institution are the very system we speak of and challenge. There is no better way than to create this change together. We are each as strong as the people we support and the fabric of compassion we create amongst ourselves.

IITD Supercomputer
Muskaan Jain

Supercomputers are computers with a high level of performance as compared to the general-purpose computers. They play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields.
An ordinary computer does one thing at a time, so it does things in a distinct series of operations; that's called serial processing. A typical modern supercomputer works much more quickly by splitting problems into pieces and working on many pieces at once, which is called parallel processing. The most common supercomputer operating system used nowadays is Linux.
In 1964, Seymour Cray invented CDC-6600 which was 10 times faster than all computers of that time. Later in 1976, Cray delivered Cray-1 followed by Cray-2 in 1985. By 1993, Intel Paragon was the fastest supercomputer in the world. Presently, Fugaku in Japan is the fastest with a speed of 415 PFLOPS. Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune hosts India‚Äôs fastest supercomputer Pratyush with a speed of 6.8 PFLOPS.
Supercomputers are used in a wide area of research and computation. The earliest Cray-1 supercomputer was used for weather forecast and aerodynamic research. As the advancement in supercomputer technology grew, they were started to be used in probabilistic analysis and 3D nuclear test simulations.
It was for this reason that the United States declined to offer a supercomputer to India fearing that it may be used for weapon development. Later India showed its technical prowess by indigenously developing PARAM 8000, which was 28 times more powerful than the one initially requested from the US. Created by C-DAC, PARAM 8000 was a success and was exported to Germany, UK and Russia. It was called the second most powerful supercomputer of its time.
These days supercomputers are also used for Molecular Dynamics simulations and for scientific research. More recently, supercomputers are being used to speed up the research on the coronavirus and vaccine development. They are being used in drug development for the coronavirus by employing them to look through databases of existing drug compounds. Various simulations are being run to find compounds that can stop the spread of the virus. Using multiple paralleled running CPU's, supercomputers are being run for hours non stop to model different processes. C-DAC in India collaborated with IITs, IISER and CSIR for performing drug repurposing simulations required towards the discovery of a new drug for COVID-19.
PARAM Padma, in 2002, became the first in India to achieve speed in teraFLOPS range. C-DAC plans to develop a supercomputer in the exaFLOPS range. The first supercomputer assembled indigenously, Param Shivay, was installed in IIT-BHU in 2019 followed by Param Shakti and Param Brahma at IIT-Kharagpur and IISER Pune, respectively.
The 860 TFLOP supercomputer in IIT Delhi is 166th fastest in the world. Based on NVIDIA‚Äôs Tesla platform, it is the largest High Performance Computing (HPC) system across all IITs. It is also the largest GPU-centric system in India and was recently upgraded in August last year which increased the raw CPU compute by 70% and GPU compute by about 40%.
The IIT Delhi supercomputer is widely used for research in molecular dynamics and virus dynamicity (to name a few). IIT Delhi also committed a total of 1 crore rupees worth of High Performance Computing (HPC) Resource for COVID-19 research. Presently, research is being carried out for finding a potential drug for the coronavirus and to find a ‚ÄúPlug & Play‚Äù solution that caters to surge in demand for ventilators in the face of medical emergencies such as COVID-19.
To quote experts, ‚ÄúSupercomputing has the potential to be the underlying layer to support solutions for many of the world‚Äôs most pressing contemporary challenges: global privacy and identity issues, stalemates in medical research, and sustainable supply-chain logistics, to name a few.‚Äù With more advanced technologies being developed to further increase the speed of supercomputers, a new age of research and development awaits us where the vaccine development would be faster and drug discovery would be easier. We will be able to better predict the weather, solve more complex algorithmic problems (like the traveling salesman problem), explore the edges of our universe, and create a more energy-smart power grid.

The Story of Corosure
BSP
Oct 6, 2020

Mar 5, 2021
How the world's cheapest testing kit came to be?
On 30th January 2020, WHO
declared
COVID-19 as a ‚ÄúPublic Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)‚Äù - the gravest degree a disease can be attributed to in the WHO categorization. This came much before countries across the globe took due cognizance of the incoming catastrophe, that would reveal the fragilities of their health-care systems in time. This alone begs a question: could we‚Äôve responded promptly and recovered better? Reflect for a moment maybe.
The under-preparedness was ominous at best; India, in particular struggled to respond efficiently and suitably to the rise in the number of cases when the virus hit. One of the major causes of concern, at least in the first quarter of the hastily implemented lockdown, was our
testing
numbers. Reports were suggestive of the mismanagement of agencies in
acquiring
the requisite number of kits from abroad, primarily because of their inexperience in the said kind of transactions. This was accompanied by extending invitations to indigneous firms and research institutes, asking them to rise up to the occasion, and develop testing kits and other necessary equipment at home. Swadeshi was to be an important aid in the battle.
Six months past the start of it all, if we are to look back at how things have shaped, there are indeed some encouraging positives to cheer for. While we await the possibility of a peak and the numbers continue to soar without a pause, our response has shown signs of improvement. We‚Äôre testing, if not adequate, but far better than what we were earlier. A closer look in this regard is telling of the many indigenous contributions that have made this possible. We at BSP were particularly fortunate to be able to interview the team of professors at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, IITD who made headlines for producing the
world‚Äôs cheapest testing kit
for COVID-19: Corosure.
The team comprises of Prof. Vivekanandan Perumal, Prof. Bishwajit Kundu, Prof. Manoj Menon, Prof James Gomes, Dr. Sonam Dhamija, Dr. Akhilesh Mishra, Dr. Parul Gupta, Prashant Pradhan (PhD Scholar), Ashutosh Pandey (PhD Scholar), Praveen Tripathi (PhD Scholar).
Hustling amidst the lockdown
The making of Corosure embodies the multidisciplinary nature of research work that is quickly garnering traction and importance. It‚Äôs a rather noteworthy fact that all the professors working on the development of kit come from different areas of specialization and augmented each other‚Äôs skillset to take the task to fruition.
The team had begun to study the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 soon after the viral sequences were separated and subsequently found two unique regions that were absent in other coronaviruses studied till date. This difference became the basis of the pathway they chose to tread along. A pertinent issue, however, was that IIT Delhi being an academic research institute, the team didn‚Äôt have access to any real virus samples for running tests. As an alternative, they had to come up with short in-vitro transcripts of the virus for testing. Logistical arrangements also suffered at the hands of the lockdown, and procurement of any chemical or equipment required permits and formalities aplenty.
With time though, the research picked up the pace, and the team had eight different testing methods, also known as diagnostic assays to try and experiment upon. The end-goal was to optimize them to an acceptable measure of efficacy.
Using comparative sequence analyses, the IIT Delhi team identified unique regions (short stretches of RNA sequences) in the COVID-19 /SARS COV-2 genome. These regions are not present in other human coronaviruses providing an opportunity to specifically detect COVID-19. This method uses primers targeting unique regions of COVID-19 that were designed and tested using real-time PCR. These primers specifically bind to regions conserved in over 400 fully sequenced COVID-19 genomes. This highly sensitive assay was developed by extensive optimization using synthetic DNA constructs followed by in vitro generated RNA fragments (Courtesy: IITD News)
En Route to NIV, Pune
A breakthrough was arrived at after the team successfully optimized one of the assays, that was now to be sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for further approval. The team sensed an immediate need to ship the assay to Pune the very next day, given the severity of the lockdown Pune was about to enter into. A delay at this point could render it practically impossible to reach Pune afterward. Luckily, they were able to find a vendor who was willing to deliver the assay to Pune on an urgent basis. The vendor was based out of Connaught Place though; and it posed a different problem altogether.
Movement in Delhi was impermissible barring essential travels, and a host of passes were required to travel outside of campus at that point. It was moonlight when these complicacies arose, and none of the members of the team could make arrangements to reach the vendor within the hard deadline of 8 P.M. Almost miraculously though, they were able to catch hold of Prashant, a student in their department, more importantly, a domicile of Delhi who had the permissions to take his four-wheeler to CP. ‚ÄúIt was touch and go,‚Äù Prof. Perumal exclaimed before adding that Prashant made it to CP in time.
ICMR Approval and Commercialisation
ICMR approval was the final stage in the queue of formalities. The evaluations at ICMR were telling of the prowess of the team as the kit was passed with a
cent percent
rates of specificity and selectivity. ‚ÄúIt is the maximum a COVID testing kit has scored in ICMR up till now,‚Äù Prof. Perumal said.
The team took the necessary steps while commercializing the kits in order to avoid a hike in the price of the kits by the companies. Non-exclusive licensing was thus done to restrict the companies from increasing the prices. Each member of the team had to spend dozens of hours with the company officials, explaining to them the working principle behind the testing kits and the process to manufacture the same.
Prof. Perumal also detailed the larger effect the kit had on the economics of testing, ‚ÄúOur testing kit significantly contributed in bringing down the price of other kits as well. When our testing kit was approved, the rest were selling at around Rs. 1200. The base price of our kit was far below than the average market price at that time and the indication of its arrival lead to a fall in the prices across the Indian market. As a result, currently, the prices of most of the testing kits are around Rs 400-600. This is one of the biggest impacts we have made.‚Äù
Team spirit at work
A retrospective outlook at the  of the trail of developing a test kit lead to a bunch of heartfelt anecdotes and support stories cropping out of the memory lane. Prof Menon, who had become a part of the IIT Delhi fraternity just a year ago expressed his satisfaction at being able to contribute, ‚ÄúI felt good that I had a role to play in this pandemic. I couldn‚Äôt imagine spending the past few months just sitting at home.‚Äù Prof Menon in fact considers his total experience in IIT Delhi equal to one plus COVID.
The team gleefully lauded the support of the students and the working staff who were a part of the research cycle, and specifically that of the Director of IIT Delhi, Prof. V. Ramgopal Rao. Prof Bishwajit remarked that the support received from the Director of the institute holds a special place in this journey, ‚ÄúOur director was available 24*7 for the team. The team considers him an equal member of this. It could not have been possible without him.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt was a huge learning experience for all of us to work in a constrained environment within a short period of time. This has shaped us as better scientists and better entrepreneurs, which will be helpful in determining our next course of action for the rest of the experiments and research work.,‚Äù Prof. Bishwajit Kundu said while summing up the insights the team had drawn from the pathbreaking research.
What ahead?
While the kit has been exceedingly well-received in the scientific community, there are signs of reluctance amongst the market players. Prof. Perumal explained this, ‚ÄúThe inertia to change was expected. Our technology is a deviation from current technology. People don‚Äôt want to change from the testing kits they have been using for the past 4-5 months. Our testing kits will thus take a few months to fully penetrate the market.‚Äù
As of now, the team happens to be working on methods to decrease the time required to test a sample. Another problem at hand is also being mulled over: as the flu season comes in, with every other person having a common cold and flu, it will become very difficult to distinguish b/w COVID and common cold/viral flu owing to the common set of symptoms. The team is trying to work a way out of this overlap.

BSP DGSec - Suhani Gupta
BSP
Nov 5, 2022
8 min read
What were your interactions with BSP during your first year?
Like most freshers, my first introduction to BSP was through Inception, the freshers magazine. I was amazed by the quality of the content in Inception and how it was a comprehensive guide to everything in IIT Delhi. I was fascinated by the way it was designed and presented and felt that the people behind it must be really interesting.
I also remember picking up copies of Muse and Inquirer from the BSP stalls in the Himadri lobby. I found Muse to be really intriguing since it was outsourced and provided an avenue for the students to express their creativity. Moreover, I read an article on casual sexism in an edition of Inquirer and was astounded that there was someone on campus raising such issues. This is what attracted me to BSP and motivated me to join the Board.
What motivated you to apply for a techie position in BSP? What was your impression of the role, and how did you find the job once selected?
As a fresher, I was inclined towards literature and writing. However, after going through some of the magazines and publications put out by BSP, particularly Inquirer, I was fascinated by the way they were designed. Soon, the pandemic hit, and we were all stuck in a state of stagnancy. That‚Äôs when I decided to explore graphic designing and tried out softwares like Adobe suite. I found that I really enjoyed designing and wanted to pursue it further. My second year started before the Design Club was formed, and BSP was one of the only campus bodies with a dedicated design vertical. So, as the recruitment process for BSP began, I applied both as a technical editor and a journalist. I got selected as the former and was told that my role would be flexible between both verticals.
As a technical editor, I had to design Instagram posts for BSP's official Instagram handle and articles that would be published on the BSP website. The design chief editors were extremely helpful; they guided me and provided insights into my graphic design skills. Apart from graphic design, I was also involved in some journalistic projects, one of them being an article on OCS, it's functioning and discrepancies in it. I conducted a few interviews for the internship series. Despite my tenure being online, it was a period when I was able to hone my skills and pursue my interests.
You‚Äôve been a part of BSP for quite some time now - first as a technical editor, then as a chief editor, and now as the DGsec. How has your journey evolved over time, and which parts have been the most enjoyable/ challenging for you?
As a technical editor at BSP, I was predominantly involved in groundwork, which included writing articles and designing content. Upon becoming a chief editor, I realised that a new dimension of accountability and responsibility was introduced to my role. Chief editors are expected to ideate content, assign work to journalists and technical editors, and manage the entire team. Apart from this, we also had to make sure that the journalists, technical and website editors were actually absorbing and assimilating our suggestions and experience into their own skillsets in order to maintain the legacy of the Board.
Even though BSP isn‚Äôt very hierarchical, both as a technical editor and a chief editor, I had someone within the board senior to me to guide me through hurdles. However, as the DGSec, that doesn‚Äôt exist. I won‚Äôt say that it is intimidating since we still have our chief editors for suggestions and guidance. However, the fact that every decision I make from now on is going to affect the entire board does however seem quite unnerving. I feel that as time passes, I will get comfortable with this increased accountability and responsibility.
Most of your BSP tenure has been during the online semesters. What apprehensions did you have pertaining to that, especially during your tenure as a chief editor?
My first year at BSP was completely online, and something I missed back then was team bonding and collaborating with the team on projects. We had just transitioned to online college, and probably that was the reason most of us weren‚Äôt really friends within the team and weren‚Äôt comfortable getting to know each other online. Our interactions at work were also meagre, as most of the design parts were distributed among technical editors independently.
As a chief editor, I, along with my co-chief editor, set out to improve the bonding within the team. I think that we were eventually able to achieve this throughout all the verticals of the Board. This was a major apprehension for us, and I‚Äôm really proud of the fact that we were able to overcome it successfully.
A major paradigm shift this semester would be to settle back into the offline functioning of all the boards in college. What does BSP have in mind to smoothen the change? Are there any important getaways from the online semesters that you‚Äôd like to keep on board?
The functioning of BSP in the coming years can be characterised as a hybrid between online and offline working. We would definitely like to utilise the facilities and experiences that the offline semester has to offer. We plan to have more in-print publications, and we are already in talks with vendors for our first offline project, Inquirer. We‚Äôd like to have more offline interactions and interviews and also want journalists, techies, and web editors to have stronger collaboration facilitated by the offline setting. For our readers, we definitely want them to experience in-print BSP publications. However, we also realise that the online mode offers improved flexibility and efficiency, especially when it comes to urgent tasks and hard deadlines. That is a feature of the online setting that we appreciate and would like to preserve.
In your manifesto, there seems to be an emphasis on visual content such as videos, comics, animations, reels etc. What were your motivations behind this idea, and what preparation would BSP have to do to implement it?
One of the major points in my manifesto was to venture into video journalism. It‚Äôs a major part of the plan for the current session, one which we‚Äôre acting on even right now through this interview. My motivation to apply for this position was to develop a much stronger video-editing vertical which is closely aligned with the design vertical. I feel that BSP hasn‚Äôt yet dabbled into video journalism, and that is something I‚Äôd want the board to explore.
During the online semesters, BSP was mostly limited to publishing text-based content on Instagram and the website. I feel that with respect to the design aspect, visual content is something the board is yet to explore to its full potential. It is something that the audience finds appealing, as every one might not be interested in reading an entire article. We‚Äôve previously made trailers for the director‚Äôs interview and would like to cover events on campus through video journalism eventually. I‚Äôd also like Bluffington to diversify to a graphical format because that‚Äôs an entertaining representation of wit. I feel that BSP has been limited in these aspects and would like the design chief editors to carry this forward.
You‚Äôve talked about creating visual arts and literary arts portals for the campus community to share their content. How do you think this increased participation and expression would impact the inherent spirit of journalism at BSP?
Literary arts was envisioned to be a creative portal without a specific focus on journalism. We‚Äôve imagined it to be a creative outlet for the IITD community, where people can put up their literary works such as stories, poems, etc. Parallel to this, I also have plans for a visual arts portal which would focus on drawings, graphic designs, and comics. I feel that comics can be an entertaining outlet for journalism. Both these portals wouldn‚Äôt have a direct impact on the journalistic activities done at BSP. Rather they would present an opportunity for the IITD community to share their literary work because, surprisingly, there isn‚Äôt any such portal yet. We‚Äôre excited to see how this portal comes out to be.
How far do you think BSP has come in covering journalistically important topics while also remaining unbiased?
BSP has covered a good number of journalistically important issues while striving to maintain an unbiased stance on all of its articles. All of our projects involve opinions and reviews of many chief editors, journalists, and technical editors, and this process ensures that biases are balanced out, and an impartial stance is presented. Our ‚ÄôInclusivity Series‚Äô, published in April,  is a good compilation of journalistically important issues. It contained a piece on women in sports and an article on the LGBTQ+ community. It was actually planned to be a long series, something we had ideated at the start of our tenure. I feel that with respect to covering journalistically important issues, there‚Äôs still a lot of scope for BSP.
While BSP has tried to cover important issues in the past, I think there have been times when we have lacked covering them in the right timeline. There have been issues that we‚Äôve identified that we wanted to publish, but because there was no established mechanism to do it in a short span of time to maintain the relevance of the piece, some of those articles could not fall through. That is something we‚Äôre planning to work on this session because we definitely need a more frequent outlet for journalistic articles. We will have a team in place to carry that forward.
Do you feel there‚Äôs scope for identifying and covering certain sensitive issues in and around the campus?
As far as sensitive issues are concerned, I believe that as the media body of the institute, BSP carries the responsibility to bring to light issues that require open conversations. Casteism is one such issue, which we haven‚Äôt had the chance to do an in-depth analysis of. We‚Äôve identified that within and outside the IITD community, including other IITs, it is a prominent concern among students, as well as faculty members. This is one such issue that we‚Äôd like to cover in our future endeavours.
Another such issue that we‚Äôve identified is related to the offline elections conducted this year. The community has approached BSP to bring to light certain instances that happened behind the curtains during the elections, and we tried our best to cover all such grievances. However, since it is an extremely sensitive issue, covering it without due care could have had damaging consequences. Other than these two issues, I feel that there are still a lot of problems that exist on campus and in other IITs, which we all know of but rarely talk about.
I feel that the reason content on such issues hasn‚Äôt been able to fall through is that every sensitive topic carries with itself certain nuances that need to be taken care of. There needs to be a strong mechanism which ensures that right from the ideation to the publication of content based on these topics, all such nuances are given due importance. This mechanism is something that we‚Äôre definitely going to work on this year. For example, the project on casteism couldn‚Äôt be successful because it was extremely intricate and delicate, and we didn‚Äôt have a proper mechanism to analyse it to our satisfaction and journalistic standards.
One needs to gather opinions and information from scholars who are experts in that field to get an overview of matters which can be touched and those which can‚Äôt. While one needs to present things candidly and unbiasedly, one also must ensure that they‚Äôre not misinformed because even the slightest inaccuracy could lead to dire consequences. However, there certainly is a lot of scope for the identification and publication of more such sensitive issues.

How was your first year as a fresher at IIT Delhi, and what was your first impression of BSW?
As a first-year student,  one thing that was different between you guys and me is that I had an offline first year. The first point of contact, both online and offline, are the BSW Reps. I think the interaction with them not only forms your first impression of BSW but also of the college. Everything a fresher learns is from BSW Representatives at first. As we know, there is a rule that you can‚Äôt talk to anyone other than your mentor (also a part of BSW) and BSW Reps for a month, so I think my first impression of BSW was that these are the guys who really take care of first-year students. I think that impression has changed over the years, but as a fresher, every fresher believes that BSW is there for first-year students and that it is the board that caters for them.
How has your journey in BSW been till now?
I started in my second year as a BSW Representative of my hostel. BSW's tenure that year was the first online tenure. It was challenging but also exciting because no one knew what to expect. One major challenge we faced was the interaction part; I think the team bonding was very weak and didn't reach the levels that existed before in offline tenures. But I think we overcame that pretty well through regular meetings and team bonding activities; we regularly had ice-breaking sessions between the team at the start, which led us to become a really good team towards the end of the tenure. As a representative, as far as I can recall, I used to do a lot of BSW work. By the end, my rep-sheet was almost filled to the brim. I had to like add extra rows after that! And I think I had done so much work as a Rep that I got to know what BSW does well and was aware of all aspects of BSW and all types of mentorships; I really learned how the team functions at the backend, which is usually not known by the students, unless you are a part of BSW. That was one of the main reasons I got into the elections to become a secretary.
I think a secretary has a lot of leeways which a representative does not have. As a Rep, you can give ideas, but as a Secretary, your ideas are considered much more than a representative because you are part of the core team. And there are regular meetings each week wherein you can present and discuss your ideas with other members of the team. So, I think as a secretary, I was able to achieve so much more than I had done as a representative. A rep does the grunt work and gets to know what the team does, and a secretary makes that work happen. I think the four secretaries of BSW are what define the team. The Coordinators do their job, the GSec and DGSec do their work, but the secretaries are the ones who make it all happen. I think they are the most integral part of the team.
Coming to mentorship, a mentor's journey is unique on its own. They cater to five students who have just come to IIT and will undergo the same things as you two years back. It's a very special and unique experience; any student who becomes a mentor will enjoy it. It's been only two and a half months since I became DGSec, but I have discovered much about the board that a secretary does not know.
It's a very different experience as now you are working on the backend of this; you need to have meetings with profs and you are working with experienced individuals who know how things work. The student team changes every year, but the Deans remain the same for at least 2 years. I really look up to Prof Reetika Khera, the last ADSW. She has the experience that makes us believe that we achieve much more than we actually can. So this has been the complete journey as of now.
When did you decide to stand for the position of BSW Deputy General Secretary and what was your motivation behind it?
Again going back to my BSW journey, as a representative,, I worked a lot towards the academic mentorship initiative. I had some great ideas then about how to contribute or change somethings to better the initiative as it was the first time we were conducting it online. So I think that was my primary motivation for getting into mentorship and changing things. As a secretary I was assigned academic and alumni mentorship, and I was able to better things over there. As I said, a secretary has a lot of leeways, but some things can only happen if you are at the team's core. That was one of my main motivations for going for mentorship in my final year. I have worked across all the mentorship programs of the board. We have also been successful in partnering with the British Council for language mentorship services at IIT Delhi. One of the reasons was also that I had been a part of Mental Health initiatives for two years now, which I want to continue.
In what ways would BSW remain memorable to you? If possible, can you share any particular incident you are immediately reminded of?
Oh my god, there are so many! I think the trips that we had are surely one of those. In our first tenure, we were all at home. I had only met some of my fellow representatives, not all of them. So the first trip we had at the end of my first tenure was very memorable. Because these are people you have been seeing online for the past eight months and have never met them in real life, so that was a trip with a bunch of people who knew each other but had never really met each other. That was really exciting and a very memorable trip for me. If you ask another, I‚Äôll perhaps go back to another BSW trip! They are fantastic in a different way altogether, difficult for me to put into words.
What things do you feel the BSW should improve upon or have been missing until now?
As I mentioned before, there is a lot of responsibility at the hands of a secretary in BSW. While we have four of them, a lot of things come down the ladder and fall upon secretaries. Often, the implementation of any new decision taken up falls upon the secretaries. I think that can really increase their workload sometimes, which we can perhaps reduce, in fact we are trying to do that. Then the team workload would distribute evenly among the secretaries and coordinators. Right now, we have four secretaries and four coordinators, each of the coordinators handles one of the mentorships, and a secretary assists them with that. So many times, the mentorship's logistical portion lands up on the secretary. I think that is something I tried to eliminate as a secretary itself; now, as a DGSec, I think I would be able to do that even better wherein we can involve the mentors and representatives directly in mentorship programs and give the secretaries a little room for going into the operations side better.
How close are you to your team? And how would you describe the efficiency of your team and BSW as a whole?
I think most of our tenure till now has been online. Even though I have a lot of experience with online tenures, having had two of them in the past two years; still in online tenures, what happens is you try to keep full team meetings,, and someone just doesn't show up or someone else has a random excuse and it's really difficult to have everyone on a call and so you can't meet everyone personally. Even if everyone introduces themselves, you don't really remember them. What makes people remember someone is when you have worked with them and interacted with them on a personal level. I think that is only possible when you interact with them offline. We've tried a lot in the past two years,, but believe me, to make that bonding among the team again, which was famous a couple of years back, when people used to say then, "Yaar, babloos ki toh alag hi team, alag hi family hoti hai"; is something which went a little missing in the online tenures.
This offline tenure has just started for the new team. It's been just two weeks, and we barely have had a full team meet. If you ask me now, I won't even be able to name all the representatives. It's such that I have been working so closely with the Dean and my mentorship coordinators that we have lost a bit of contact with the representatives. But I am sure that this will not be the case as soon as we start having offline full team meets and fun sessions.
Mental Health has been the buzzword in IITD, with BSW taking significant measures to ensure it gets due importance in yesteryears. How far have we tackled this issue after the implementation of SCS and YourDost? What initiatives have you planned for this year?
A student's first interaction with the Counselling Services is through a session wherein they come to the hostels and interact with all the students. One of the initiatives we have planned for this year is to have perhaps a more personal interaction between the counsellors and the students. Wherein the counsellor is not talking to a whole bunch of students but a small subsection of the students at a time. I think that will surely encourage a lot of students to open up with the counsellor. I think one of the issues I have now realized after interacting with the counsellors personally is that the counsellors have busy schedules. They are really busy many times of the day and many students are coming in for help from the counsellors, which is a great thing I must say. If you look at the numbers from YourDost, they have also been experiencing a surge. If we go by numbers, A lot of students are now opening up, and I think the publicity by the BSW team has played a big role in this. We have worked hard in the past few years and made this culture happen in the online semesters. Mental Health is now being talked about a lot more than it used to be previously. As you said yourself that it is very prevalent in IITD now, I think that is something we have been able to achieve. Talking about what we would do in future, one of the initiatives we started last year was the Student Support Team. We are looking forward to continuing that. We'll try to implement that as much as possible in offline mode so that the students can take benefit from that. And another thing I would like to add is that our mentors have been undergoing training for the past two years to be more prepared and knowledgeable about how to identify and approach such issues.
IITD will be welcoming Freshers in offline mode this time, after two batches having faced online mode before their on-campus onboarding. How different will it be for BSW this time with respect to ensuring a smooth welcoming of Freshers? Have you planned anything special in this regard?
This takes me back to my first year when BSW welcomed us. I think the orientation into IIT Delhi is a really important phase which also went missing in the online semesters. I'll briefly describe how the orientation goes about. So you come to IITD as a student and go to many rooms to complete many different formalities, but you will always find BSW reps there. They will take some notes, complete some formalities, and then hand out your mentor's letter. That is the level of interaction that happens with BSW at the very start of your stay at IITD. The orientation occurs in the morning, and by evening the BSW reps welcome them to the hostels and take them out for evening games on the very first or second day. So that is the actual icebreaker session, which the online students missed out on. And that is something which is really great we are looking forward to doing it this time over. When you go out with a whole bunch of students from so many hostels, all branches who have just come to IITD, who are just as clueless as you were sometime back, that is something really different. You make so many friends on the first day itself; I think it's great that we have BSW for the orientation process. We'll have those evening games sessions as soon as possible for this new batch of freshers because that is a special thing I remember from my first year!
BSW has also come up with this new initiative of Alumni Mentorship, where pre-final year students receive mentorship from alumni excelling in their field of interest already. Can you elaborate on Alumni mentorship and what initiatives have already been taken in this regard? What can we expect in future in this section?
So, it's not really a new initiative; it's been around for quite some time now. In Alumni mentorship, we plan to connect students (mostly prefinal year students) directly with alums. These students are looking forward to how they will go about their careers and really need advice. What usually happens is that people try to approach alums on LinkedIn, a common thing people at IIT Delhi do towards the start of their prefinal years. We plan to bridge that gap through this alumni mentorship and connect students directly with alums. But in the online tenure, that became a little difficult to do. So, alumni mentorship got divided into multiple things. Now we have so many things under the umbrella; we have an interview series with alumni called Alumniescence, where we have many alumni from various fields: UPSC Graduates, STEM industry, Consulting etc. That has helped students know how these people shaped their careers after IIT Delhi. What we have started now in offline tenure in Alumni mentorship is we have identified alums from multiple fields and have started connecting students with them. We've been allotting 5-6 students to each alum. They are really helpful, and from the feedback, we have received, it has been really beneficial for the students and the alums. Even they wanted to know what has happened to campus now and how students were going about online. We have started again in the past two months, and there is a lot of scope for improvement in alumni mentorship, is what I'd like to say.
The 2020 entry batch
is
seeing offline semesters for the first time, and hence most of
them
don‚Äôt know how to manage things, while they will now be mentors and are supposed to help juniors with this. How does BSW plan on tackling this?
For 2020 students, we‚Äôve been trying to plan a special kind of mentor training this time wherein we are planning to train mentors much more than just the regular mentor training we had previously. I think 2020 students have started to become accustomed to the campus, but there are still many things they don‚Äôt know. So we are planning some things in our training to help them become aware of the campus issues so that they can help the incoming freshers.
Any final message to our audience?
I would say that these coming years will be really different for students who have not experienced offline life at campus. I think the students have become accustomed to just staying at home, staying at beds and doing class. You should take this opportunity to start attending classes in offline mode, because you can just learn so much more than in online. There are people who have been able to work well in online mode, but its just so much more chaotic in offline, so many things are happening which makes it really really exciting. I too have not experienced that much of an offline life, I have to admit. I think have spent 7-8 months on campus in first year. Take this time what you have seriously because literally time flies. It goes away so quickly. And I think that would be my final message, really enjoy yourselves at campus and just try to explore all what you can because there is so much to do!

How would you describe your first year at IITD? How was your experience?
My first year was all about cricket; when I came to IIT, I had decided that I had to play inter-IIT anyhow, so my first semester was all about it. I even missed Speranza, BRCA orientation, and other important events and unfortunately, I couldn't make it to inter-IIT team, and even my acads were a little bit miss balanced. So in the second semester, I tried to balance things. I reduced my time for cricket and started studying more and startedparticipating in some cultural activities. I even participated in inter-hostel Drama and GD (till practice) while all this was going on, minors  were approaching, and then; we got the covid mail and were told to go home, which sums up my first year. My mentors and seniors told me to try different things. I didn't listen to them at first and just focused on cricket and neglected other opportunities around me, but later I realised that they were right, and when I became a mentor, I ensured that my mentees wouldn't make the same mistake.
How did your journey with BSA begin, and how has the experience been until now?
I did not know  anything about BSA in my first year when I was playing. I just went to play cricket and only knew about the hostel sports secretary. I was a regular and earnest player who used to play, so when I came to my second year, our hostel sports secretary became the DGSecy of BSA and made me an executive in BSA. Things were online at that time, and BSA organised some new online events, I contributed a lot in managing those events; this way I made a lot friends in BSA,. And I bonded with many seniors, and from this point, my journey with BSA began‚Ä¶
What has been your best memory with your team?
I have played many matches with the team and have many pleasant memories. In one of those matches, we were in a tight situation. The game was on our side, but the person who threw the second last over gave away a lot of runs, so in the final over only few runs were left to defend and I had to bowl the final over. In the final over, I just gave 2-3 runs, and we won. It's a lovely memory with my team. I also have good memories of playing with/against the alumni team and the junior teams.
How was your experience as Sports Secretary? Any memorable incident that you'd like to share?
First of all, it was a real hassle after which I became the sports secretary so once I became the sports secy I was really motivated to win the GC. So when it was finally announced, we were really excited. I often used to sit with all the first yearites and decide our course of action. We used to plan on board the SWOT of different hostels and stuff like that. All this bonded me a lot with them. I used to go to the Dean's office so that all those PG players who don't have any hostel and would like to play would be allotted my hostel. And we would get an edge over other hostels by having  more PG participation
The Election season is difficult and stressful for all. Could you tell us about your experience of the same?
Yaar... elections are stressful, I always had a wish to contest, and I also had the support of many seniors. Elections were extraordinary for me. You have to make people aware of your SOP, so I narrated my SOP to 125 people. BT toh hoti hai, I often used to miss lunch and sometimes even dinner. You need to work really hard for elections. The results were great, and when I look back, I feel that "Sahi Tha". Often relationships are also spoilt in this time, and this is something terrible, but overall you learn many new things.
In the transition from Online to Offline, the participation of people in sports has decreased considerably. How do you plan to increase it?
So currently, I am DGSecy in BSA, and there is a hierarchy in BSA, so I can't go to every place and motivate people, but this year there were like two meetings of the Board. In those, we emphasised on this point to the sports secys that it's your work to ensure that as a team, from every individual hostel, there is maximum participation in sports. We need to work on this as a team to make the change.  Apart from this, we plan to restart the BSA orientation, which happened every year before covid. And we are also deliberating over restarting the refreshments for the team.
You mentioned in your manifesto about organising a BSA Orientation. Can you tell us more about when and how you plan to make it happen? You also mentioned that refreshments would be provided for players. What will it constitute, and when will it begin?
Just like BRCA orientation, BSA orientation used to happen in Dogra hall, so for the upcoming year, we want to organise a proper BSA orientation of all sports in Dogra Hall. So that everyone knows what all sports they can try out on campus.
Pre-covid, the whole team used to drink juice or eat something, and BSA reimbursed everything. This might be a small thing, but I have talked to seniors who have passed out, and they said things like these motivate more people to play sports.
Many people are excited about the GC. When can we expect it, and what all changes will be there from the previous GC?
If covid doesn't come, we hope to hold GC in January after the inter IIT. As for change, you can expect that earlier, and everyone knew which hostel was good in what sports and all, but now it's pretty vague. Every hostel has an open chance of winning any tournament. So let's see.
There has been a lot of talk about inter-IIT lately. What can we expect from inter-IIT this year?
So this year, inter-IIT is being hosted by Delhi+Roorkee, so some games like Basketball, Badminton, Athletics, Chess, Aquatics, and TT will be held here. You can expect the aquatics meet to occur sooner than the rest of the games, which are planned for late December. The campus will be lively during that time, with a lot of heated cheering and anti-cheering during the matches. So I would like to say that you should see how inter-IIT is kept and cheer for our team. And if you plan to stay over the winter break, there will be some open for all events in which you can participate for fun.
Any note that you'd like to leave for our audience?
I want to say something which I feel a lot after covid, that people are looking at things way too objectively, like should I perform in XYZ activity? What will I get back? Over this, I'd like to say that if you've come to IIT, you should also enjoy it a little. From my experience, the people who've inspired me the most are those who aren't afraid to do things they love. I feel everyone should bring this change in themselves. If you like something, then pursue it. I won't say that just spoil your career over that, but you can always manage to give some time to it. Try to do some things you like, and do them just for fun. This is especially true for sports. We don't play to add some points to our CV.
Another thing, like most fachhe, only have "POR waale senior" as the point of contact. I feel that this is really bad. There are lots of
machau
seniors who do a lot of things and don't have PORs. I think this needs to change.

What was your first impression of BSW?
The first impression I had of BSW was when I first came to IITD as a fresher. It was three years ago, and when I entered my hostel, Kailash, both the BSW reps (we fondly call them babloos) were sitting and chatting in the visitor's room. They helped us with every little thing, from moving into our rooms to adjusting to the new life, which got very overwhelming at times. In fact, my parents also commented that they're putting in so much effort to ensure student welfare and that they're so helpful and approachable. I remember that when I had my minor exams in the first semester, I was not able to cope up with the pressure. I was really stressed about my academics and I spoke to one of my reps. She comforted and consoled me about how things work and how should I go about them, and that instilled a sense of comfort in me. Over time, I felt that I too needed to help my juniors and pass on the knowledge and love I had received. So, when the form for the BSW representatives rolled out, I filled it and luckily got the position.
What's one thing you really love about BSW, and one thing you'd like to change?
The one aspect of BSW I really love is the bonding between the representatives and seniors. It almost feels like a family and a second home to me. In fact, my whole rep tenure was online and the first time I met my fellow representatives was when we all went for a trip. We were just a handful of strangers, and I hadn't met any of them before. Even though we barely knew each other, we bonded extremely well and it was so comforting to know that there is genuine affection and care among students. The new friends I made were very considerate and helped me in every little aspect. The one part that I would like to change is to sensitise the reps more and make them learn how to deal with different situations and act maturely, basically to focus more and more on rep training process.
You have contributed extensively to both the operations and the mentorship verticals of BSW. Which initiative of yours are you most proud of?
My entire rep tenure was online, so I was mainly assisting the secretaries. But when I myself became a secretary last year, I was able to conduct two offline events. One was an initiative we took for mental health day, where we posted boards in Wind-T, where people can write what made them happy. To be honest, we thought it wouldn't attract a lot of responses, but the enthusiasm we witnessed was huge. It brought participation not just from students, but from faculty members and security guards alike. I felt it was a good effort we took to keep spirits high on campus. The other event I conducted was STIC Dinner, which is a student-teacher interaction event. I organized this event in three hostels, and I managed the event flow, coordinated with POCs and professors to ensure that it was a success.
In your manifesto, you expressed your interest in revamping the BSW website. What new initiatives are you planning to take in this regard?
The BSW website was created 4 years ago, before the pandemic. Since then, we have had two online years, and have switched again recently to the offline mode. Now, most clubs and boards have adapted to a hybrid mode, which has both online and offline aspects. So, the website needs to be revamped accordingly.
You mentioned in your past contributions that you worked on setting up sanitary pad dispensers on the campus. How did you overcome the societal stigma around this sensitive issue?
This was an initiative I took in my secretary tenure and it has continued till date. I received a complaint from a student who explained the practical difficulty of carrying sanitary pads everywhere. She suggested to the BSW team that we can install pad dispensers on campus, and we took action. We have installed dispensers in washrooms that are far from the girls' hostels, such as the lecture hall complex, the main building, SAC, the central library etc. Earlier, it used to operate on a coin-based system, but now we are trying to switch to the UPI system which will be more convenient.
You've also worked a lot on spreading awareness about mental health and launching portals for the same. When did you realise the need for such a platform and how do you plan to approach this problem?
I realized the importance of mental health in my first year, when I felt overwhelmed because of my academics and the college atmosphere. My major and minor exams caused a lot of stress, and there were some mishaps too. When I became a BSW representative, I got to know about the vertical of BSW that deals with mental health and I contributed a lot on that front in my rep tenure. I then became the mental health secretary, and I genuinely wanted to help students out. In fact, I had some close friends who were suffering from intense academic and extracurricular pressure, and were spiraling into depression. Seeing this, we decided to create a portal where students can interact anonymously and pour out their feelings. This student chat data is available only to the counselors, and even BSW does not have access to this data. So, it is completely anonymous, and would not be leaked under any circumstances. This portal has benefited a lot of students.
Speranza, the annual fest of BSW, will be conducted in offline mode this year. How will you approach this shift and what new events can we expect?
Speranza is the first fest after the freshers arrive. It consists of a plethora of events like Mr and Ms Fresher, Prom Night etc. These events are meant to increase interaction and break the ice. We will try our best to incorporate offline events, not just for the incoming freshmen, but also for those from the 2021 batch, since they did not get to experience an offline Speranza either. There will be quite a few new and different sort of events for the students which you might know in time.
You've also mentioned in your vision that you'd like to initiate a rep training program. Why did you feel the need to do so?
When the freshers first arrive on campus, their main points of contact are the respective hostel representatives. For roughly a month or so, their interaction is quite restricted and is limited to the reps. In such a case, the reps should be able to comfort the students in case of any mishap, and they should be able to help them out in case of any difficulty or trouble. The jump from school to college can be quite staggering, and they need a strong support system in place to guide them. There should be no instances of negligence or unresponsiveness from the reps. They should know what is right, and should be adept in tackling situations with precision, humility and grace.
One of BSW's objectives is to increase interaction among the freshers and make them feel more comfortable. How did BSW transition from the offline to the online mode in this regard, and what were the challenges faced?
One of the main challenges we faced was that many students from underprivileged backgrounds did not have access to high-speed internet. They kept facing connectivity issues and were unable to interact with fellow friends and seniors. So, we couldn't really interact with everyone online. But we did conduct numerous ice-breaker and inter-hostel sessions to enable students to get to know their peers and widen their friend's circle. The BSW mentors also organised meets with their mentees, guiding them about academics, hostel culture, extracurricular activities, finding friends etc.
Any final message for the readers?
My message for students would be to not hesitate to ask for help. If you face any problem or difficulty in anything whatsoever, don't be reluctant to approach your hostel representatives, secretaries, club coordinators and other seniors. We all would be more than glad to help you out so feel free to reach out anytime. There's no need for you to take extra stress or tension, when you can seek guidance from a senior who's just a call away.

SAC DGSec - Ashi Jain
BSP

Updated:
Nov 5, 2022
What did your freshman year at IITD look like? How was it different compared to the regular offline semesters?
I had a fascinating and eventful first year. In comparison to my surroundings, covid was not as harsh for me. So overall, the 3 to 4 years I had in my college life were pretty good. I observed a vast difference between online and offline semesters. In the first year, you generally become acquainted and become friends with your group mates; in the second year, you get to explore your branch. This one significant change is what we, as a batch whole, did not get to experience. Now that I am back on campus, I feel at home.
What did your participation in clubs and extracurricular activities look like in the first year?
I was involved in many clubs in my first year. I actively participated in DebSoc and went to external competitions as well. I used to sing and was a part of Cadence, and I also did a street play. I wanted to explore my college life to the fullest and thus participated in a plethora of activities.
In your second year, how did managing extracurriculars, club activities, and academics play out for you?
We were in a void, hanging in a gap for approximately six to seven months where no academic or cultural activity occurred. I remember singing at one of the music club events, but there's a stark difference between offline and online activities. I sang, recorded and listened to my voice which may not be the smartest thing to do. I became a part of BSW in my second year, so I organized numerous events, due to which my participation in extracurricular activities declined slightly. Being a BSW rep took much of my time, which I was happy to devote as I enjoyed my work. I devoted the rest of my time to academics.
What were your initial interactions with SAC, and how did you plan on joining SAC eventually?
My first interaction with SAC was in the second year after joining BSW. In BSW I found out about the duties a student board generally has and the activities it undertakes. My SAC secretary Ishika Verma was very active in SAC, so she was my essential link to SAC and its functioning. We used to get WhatsApp notifications about initiatives of SAC alongside the decisions made in the meeting in the form of minutes of the meeting; for example, the revamped audit policy during covid was one of these significant decisions. This is how I got to know about SAC.
Describe your journey from the first interaction to becoming the SAC DGSec.
I could relate and draw parallels between BSW and SAC primarily because both function for the welfare of the student community as a whole. SAC is a decision-making body, and we'd often collaborate with different boards to implement these decisions. I looked up to the person in the position, and I thought that this was something I would like to take up in the future and something that I could do. That's why I became the SAC secretary, and as a SAC secretary, I made great strides with SAC GSec and DGsec. When the campus reopened, the transition started taking place, and we could feel the difference in the work as we did not know when the covid waves would end. The projects changed, and the way they had to be implemented changed. This is how I went from knowing about SAC to becoming the DGSec.
Your manifesto talked about crucial and novel initiatives such as installing sanitary pad dispensers, safety issues on campus, query redressal systems, etc. Can you explain them in general, and how do you plan on executing them?
As we move into a digitalized world, the old sanitary dispensers which need the insertion of a coin need to be upgraded. Thus, we are working in collaboration with BHM and BSW on the project of installing new sanitary pad dispensers. We'll be implementing this in hostels, LHC, etc. In such projects and initiatives, many factors and negotiations come into play that needs to be approved by the administration.
I'd like to speak about safety issues within the constraints of information that I can reveal. Lately, during fests and other events, many safety issues have been reported on campus, and we would like to avoid such incidents as much as possible. Through this initiative, we'll be installing boards across the campus and distributing brochures comprising of emergency contacts such as the security office, women helpline, hospital other emergency contacts. This will ensure the safety of IITD residents in case of any emergency. We are working on a query redressal system to address queries, doubts and concerns of the student body as we go offline after a long gap
In your manifesto, you've also emphasized the need of increasing PG participation and representation in SAC. How do you plan on ensuring the same, and what are the steps you are currently taking?
PG participation and inclusion in the SAC are integral and necessary. The first step is to have an introductory orientation for PG and UG sections to familiarize them with the working of IITD. Following this, we are trying to incorporate PG advisors so that they can aid in the process of planning initiatives and implementing them. We have a new team coming up full of enthusiasm and zeal, willing to ensure PG's inclusion in the whole of IIT Delhi.
As the DGSec of SAC, are there any changes you would like to make in the student body?
Whenever we go about making a major policy change, we have to follow a certain procedure. There has to be proper discussion and deliberation in order to implement anything. First, we conduct a small-scale survey, for example, amongst the POR holders, to get a rough idea about the problems and their probable solutions. Subsequently, we conduct an exhaustive institute-wide survey through google forms to get the opinion of the IITD student body. After thoroughly reviewing responses and compiling them, we present the case to higher-ups in SAC meetings and try to implement the changes. Naturally, if I feel something is problematic and needs to be changed, I'd discuss it with board members and boards like BHM, BSW, BSA, BRCA, BSP or whomsoever is concerned. The things we are currently working on in SAC are a part of our vision, be it Kartik's or mine. We try to implement every favorable policy for the betterment of the student community. We are trying to establish a better mechanism of Yulu. We are getting in touch with the concerned authorities and encouraging them to develop a better plan for IIT Delhi. We are trying to implement an inter-hostel movement in IIT Delhi, which is present in other IITs like IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, etc. To improve our relations with the alumni network, we are trying to organise more events involving them. These are some initiatives that SAC is currently working on.
Is there something you would like the readers to know about SAC?
SAC functions as an interface between different student bodies and the authorities. SAC is, at its core, the ever-so-important bridge between the student community and administration. As the apex student body, it is our duty to incorporate and deliberate student concerns and take them up with authorities.

Oct 31, 2022
How was your experience as a Fresher at IITD?
As a fresher, I had a great experience during my initial months. I already had a lot of friends from my coaching days, who were already at IIT Delhi, and they supported me a lot
in making make
my transition to college life very smooth. Initially, I was not very involved in some particular club or activity and usually enjoyed the college experience by interacting and making new friends. Later, I got involved in playing sports and was actively participating in hockey and athletics.
How‚Äôs your journey been till now at IITD?
Amazing. It has been an extraordinary experience for me to study at IITD. Most of my first year was spent participating in sports and playing hockey, and then in the second year, with the arrival of Covid, classes shifted online. And most of the second year just went in chilling at home. At the close of my second year, I was introduced to CAIC. I always had a slight inclination towards administrative roles, so I contested for the post of U.G. Convener of Electrical Dept. and I, fortunately, won by one vote, so the journey was going nice, and ever since the third year, my tenure has been great. I have worked with entire CAIC team for the new structure, apart from that, I never even imagined that I would even become the General Secretary, and now looking back, I feel that the journey has been incredible.
How did you learn about CAIC and what CAIC clubs have you been a part of?
I haven't been part of any CAIC club yet, but I attended the orientation of all the clubs, and after that, I felt that sports would suit me better, so I chose to devote my time there. About CAIC, I first heard the term by the end of the second year at the time of the U.G. Convener elections, so basically, at that time, I got to know about CAIC. After that, I got fully aware of the CAIC body, and it‚Äôs functioning.
When did you make up your mind to contest for GSec? What was your prime motivation for it?
As I mentioned before, my prime motivation was to work towards all-round development of the council. Currently, a lot of people are unaware about CAIC, and due to this, I felt there was a need to restructure the body. My ideas also resonated with those of the previous GSec, and how he has taken some steps and laid a path for this, such as setting standard metrics for the clubs and unifying them, because a lot of those function on their own terms which makes the process a bit haphazard.
What do you plan to do now that you‚Äôve become the GSec?
Currently, we want people to know about CAIC and what exactly it does. The council's work is not known to most U.G. students, since most of our work is with P.G. students. Even many P.G. students don't know about CAIC, so I want to ensure that people know properly what CAIC is and what it does. We would be conducting orientations, to give people a proper understanding and working of the council. Restructuring the working of the body, is also one of the important tasks, as it would help in many ways.
What are the issues you expect to encounter in the offline semesters?
Mainly, in online semesters people didn‚Äôt know about much things so there weren‚Äôt any issues as most problems were solved at the convener level. But in offline mode, things are gonna be a little bit hectic, many PhD people have some important issues but they are some things that occur every year, so hopefully, everything will work around.
Many people don‚Äôt even know about CAIC and the work it does, what do you think about it?
There was a lack of orientation and seminars about the council to the new batches, which makes people usually aware a bit late of the body. And mostly, the first-year students don‚Äôt encounter many problems at the academic or administrative level, which gives them less exposure to the body. We are woking on mechanisms to increase the social media outreach andThere is an idea to establish a CAIC secretary in every hostel, which would help towards solving this issue.
Students often have issues regarding academics in the first year and they don‚Äôt know who to approach, especially the introverted ones, since there are no conveners among freshers and sophomores. How do you plan to change it?
There are two types of students, first, those students who are in different clubs have P.O.R. and stuff, they generally don't have any problem. The second type of students are those who don't open up easily and interact less. The main priority is the second type of students who are comparatively shy and introverted. So it becomes important to have impactful reach so that these students are also aware of the process and can avail themselves access to different resources and mechanisms.
Any insights about TRYST 2023, that you would like to share?
I can only promise that the second semester's midterm break will be well worth the wait.
What do you plan to do about recognising new tech clubs like ANCC and  AIMLC?
In this or the next semester, as Dean (Acads) changes, we will have an EC meeting, where the official recognition
will
be proposed as part of the agenda. If their presentation goes well, and the Deans are on board, then definitely they‚Äôll be a part of the CAIC.
What are the PG initiatives you have on your mind currency
? Can
you brief them?
PG is facing many monetary issues as of now. First is the contingency issue it's the money allotted to every PhD student for research purposes. The problem
with
it is that you can spend this money on a few specific things only. Even now there are restrictions like you can buy online courses but not
pen drives,
so we need to work over that. Apart from that, there are problems regarding scholarships, like some people have scholarships of five years, but due to covid, their degree now spans six years. We are trying that they get the scholarship from MHRD for their final year.
The last GSec presented about changes in CAIC structure with the new structure of reps and DGSecs, are you thinking on similar lines too?
Ya, I am thinking on similar lines, there is very much need for the restructuring of CAIC, there is one GSec handling a lot of things so things get a little bit messy. Therefore we really wish to bring two DGSec, one for handling Acads and the other for Co-curricular and clubs activity and the two will report to the GSec.
Any message for our audience?
I want that students know more about the different student bodies and councils that are there on campus for them. They should know how much they can influence the things on campus. For example, currently
,
there‚Äôs a curriculum review going on which takes place every 10 years or so in which you can pretty much get anything changed such as getting design credits removed, new courses being introduced, etc. So as a General Secretary, I wish that the students approach their corresponding representatives with more ideas which they believe would be beneficial for all.

What were your impressions of BSW when you first joined as a fresher at IIT Delhi? How has your journey been in BSW, and what made you choose it over any other board or club?
I remember I came here on some day in July, and as I entered here, I could see two guys handling a crowd, saying things like, "come here," "go there," "take this form," and "get that scanned." Those guys were none other than my babloos-Prakhar and Deepanshu. They were my first point of contact‚Äîthe representatives from BSW, as I could also see written on their T-shirts. They told me what to do, what not to do, and where to get all the basic things. They also conducted a session that day in which we were informed of what we could expect from the college, the hostel, and how our four-year journey at IIT Delhi would be.
It was then that I realized that these guys were someone important, but I did not at that point think that I would like to be the BSW representative. I just wanted to explore different things in college.
After orientation, we had frequent meetings with them, and after a few months, I learned that the BSW's responsibility was not just to guide freshers but also to intervene if a fresher needed support. It matched my personal goal of creating some sort of impact in the lives of people around me. From that day onwards, I thought this was something I could do if I got an opportunity.
I tried dancing and other activities too, but I couldn't fit anywhere as I had no talents.
Therefore, I chose BSW above any other board because it was completely aligned with my personal goal and I saw how my seniors were doing things and how impactful their work was.
As for my journey, it's been a long and exciting journey. When I became a representative, COVID happened, and we had to start everything from scratch. Our GSec, Ayush Sir, and all the secretaries gave us a vision we had to work for. It was very challenging for us because I wanted to talk to people in person rather than online and find out what was happening in their lives. It was tough to handle an online batch as there was no interaction, and it was a good enough challenge to keep me motivated.
I remember once we helped the COVID patients by providing oxygen cylinders, and we were appreciated a lot by the director for it. It gave me the idea that I was doing something good, something impactful, and I should try to go ahead in this chain and stay with this goal only. That's why when the secretary post came, I went ahead for the same. Under the guidance of my GSec Prakhar, I, as a secretary, was doing things related to British Council. I closely saw the problems people from different backgrounds had regarding language. It was then that I realized the overall impact that BSW was creating, and this impact motivated me every day. This was my journey with the Board for Student Welfare.
When did you decide to contest for BSW Gsec and what motivated you to do so?
I never decided to be the general secretary, but things just came up like that. Since I had spent two years in the board, I wanted to continue my tenure and also wanted to serve the board again. Knowing that my tenure would be offline added to my motivation to go ahead for the post because it appeared that the role would be the key to bringing back the offline college culture as it used to be. I want freshers, and for that matter, everyone to see the college events which we saw in our first year.
What are some existing initiatives that resonate with you and you wish to carry forward?
This is a very interesting question because, as a representative, you don't know what all the things are going on and you think that you are doing most of the work while the people above you are not doing anything. As a secretary too, I felt that I am the one doing the muscle work, taking all the initiative, and doing everything in the board. Then the day I became the GSec and got access to the email id from Prakhar, I got to know that there are so many things that come under BSW.
For example, some people on campus have a credit backlog and have been staying on campus for a long time. There is a lot of mental toll on them, and I just wanted to do something about it. We were having meetings about it with the deans so that we could do something fruitful and have some provisions for them so that if they are not able to complete the whole degree, they can have some professional or minor degree with which they can graduate.
Another major thing that BSW has been doing and I wish to improve is the facility of providing loans. If anyone is in need and wants a loan, then BSW provides loans at zero interest to the students. It is basically funded by the student's security money, which is donated to the student welfare account. I want to increase that account's total deposit by increasing awareness so that we can help even more people.
Talking about other initiatives, onboarding British Council was something that I was passionate about, and I have been working on this for the last two years. When I was a representative, I used to write emails about this. During my secretary tenure too, I was assigned language mentorship, and I regularly worked in contact with the British Council team and now, in my tenure, we finally signed an MoU with them and started our classes on 17th August.
What are the biggest challenges in front of BSW right now, and how do you plan to tackle them?
At the start of my tenure, I decided that we would be increasing the Board's impact on PG students this time because even though we have some PG-oriented initiatives planned, we don't have much outreach or social media presence among them. There are a lot of services we provide that people are unaware of, so even if I can give the correct information to the person who needs it, it will be a significant achievement for BSW.
Another challenge that I have to work on very carefully about is bringing back the offline culture. The batch who is secretary now or the batch who is representative now in the Board doesn't have any offline experiences and has not seen anything happening offline, be it orientation or fests. It will be very challenging, especially when the freshers come in October, as we will have to conduct mass orientation and other events we have planned.
Apart from this, we will now have ODI(Office of diversity and inclusion) onboarded as the third vertical of the Board.
ODI will consist of IGES, Indradhanu, OAE, SC/ST cell and counselling services. Bringing them under the Board's umbrella, integrating them properly, building a team for starting vertical-specific operations and giving the stakeholders equal respect so that no one feels hurt is one of the biggest challenges which  BSW has and I am looking forward to it.
What is one thing you have achieved with BSW that you are proud of?
Onboarding the British council for our language mentorship program was a long dream. I am glad that with the help of all my previous teams' work, we could finally start the operations.
Apart from this, the successful integration of the office of diversity and inclusion in the board is something I look forward to. I am very proud that we as an institution are now more aware of the existing diversity on our campus and trying to give them equal representation.
You have conducted so many successful events in the online semester for freshers, but conducting it offline in the upcoming year will be even more challenging as most of the people in the BSW team have not done much work offline. How do you plan on that?
Everybody knows that we have representatives and secretaries who do not have first-hand experience of conducting offline events, and our batch was lucky enough to witness how things are done offline, at least when we were freshers. I plan to conduct as many meetings/training workshops as possible for the team and give my secretaries and representatives freedom because this is the batch that will learn new things now. The only way to learn is to do things themselves, make mistakes and learn from them, and I will always be there to correct them when needed. Giving them the right vision and liberty to do things their own way will help them grow as individuals. Also, I think our batch has to be more involved than previous teams; the 4th yearites-the Board‚Äôs GSec and DGSecs will be involved more in the board activities rather than just the administrative work.
BSW has been very active in spreading awareness about mental health and counseling to the students, but still, many students on campus do not reach out for counseling even when in need. How will you ensure that every needy student connects with a counselor?
Yeah, so this is a problem we are aware about, that people are not reaching out, and this has been a trend for a very long time though the number of people reaching out has increased in an online setting. I think there is a huge stigma attached to going to a counsellor.
To reach out to more people, we have onboarded Yourdost again and have renewed their contact. Yourdost is an organisation that ensures the availability of counsellors 24/7, and by logging into its website, you can anonymously connect to some counsellors and take their help. The anonymity part of Yourdost is crucial because many people feel insecure about sharing their issues. The main goal of this mental health team here is awareness about normalization of topics such as mental health and about the ease of availing counselling services. Earlier, the process was not so simple, like we had to go to the office and book a session, but now we have made an online portal for it. Now, it is very easy to book an appointment, and even if your friend needs an appointment then too, you can easily book the same for them. We'll try to increase counselor visits to hostels so that students can connect with and feel familiar to them, thus making it easier for them to reach out when in need.
You have talked about revamping the Language Mentorship program in your manifesto. Considering how vital the program is for many students, how will you implement it, and what changes will you bring?
Even during my secretary tenure, we revamped the program a bit. When I was representative, we had some pre-defined lessons on basic grammar details, which did not appear very helpful to me and were removed by me back then. During my secretary tenure, when I was coordinating with the language mentorship domain, I focussed on the relevant stuff only. We divided the program into three phases -where in the first phase, we covered basic English like nouns, pronouns, etc.. In the second phase, we went on to teach the relevant things, e.g., essay writing and report writing, which might be helpful to you in presentations or company interviews. Then in the third part, we used to screen a movie and ask people to write its summary. Initially, when we were onboarding people, we asked people to write us a message about their expectations of the program. We then compared the summary with that initial message and analysed the difference made. In my GSec tenure, we have onboarded British Council, which has a set standard program with which we are in a financial contract and have allocated around 40 lakhs for the same. A very important thing here is that they can't cater to everyone. The program will run for students of all years, and this time it is for PG students too.They also need it because many people have completed their secondary and higher education in Hindi or some other language and need English assistance. Apart from the British Council program, we have another specialised program too. The people who are left will be catered to by this specialised program, which we are trying to design based on feedback we got in the past.
BSW has done great work for UG freshers in the past, but it seems not enough is done for PG. Why is it so, and do you plan on anything to increase your reach to them too?
What you mentioned is correct. Until now, we used to conduct only UG orientation and provided basic services for PG orientation, but this time we had a proper orientation setup for them. We had set up some of the stalls centred around the PG students in the first few weeks, like bank stalls, sim card stalls, and also accommodation providers, as not everyone is accommodated in the hostels. Generally, the PGs (especially M.Tech. males) are not accommodated in a hostel and look for places outside the hostel, so we curated a list of the PGs (paying guests) available around the college and provided these lists and even invited some of the PGs to come to college to tell about their services. Moreover, to increase the outreach, by the end of September, we will also be having PG executives. Their primary focus will be to get ideas from their batchmates on what they want to be and what events they want us to conduct for them and to increase our presence among them. We offer many services that they are unaware of, and I guess having a PG executive will surely help and increase our outreach.
You have also emphasized the alumni mentorship program for third-yearites in your manifesto. Why do you feel it is needed and what are your plan and expectations for the same?
When a person joins IIT, he is allotted a mentor, who is generally from the third year and gives one all the basic guidance that is needed, be it about the GPA, schedule, or anything that one might face trouble in. By the time a person completes his second year, there is a lot of noise around him/her about internships, etc. All of this leads to confusion, which hits harder when your mentor is not in the college because they generally passout by that time. When our mentor is on campus and in front of our eyes, it is effortless to go to them and take any help, but when a person goes away, one would feel that they are in the corporate world and have no obligation to help now. Thus we think we should provide alumni mentors to our third-year students to help them, and I will tell you how we will choose the mentors and implement this program.
After the first year, you don't know what the available options are, and after the second year, you have a rough idea that there is this consulting domain, there is this HFT then there is SDE and analytics. So we took a survey about what the students wanted, and in case some people felt they wanted to explore consulting, we reached out to some of our alums who are in consulting and asked them to become our alumni mentors, and then we mapped these. Our final goal is to have alumni mentor for all third-year students, and it is a long-term process, and we just had a very successful pilot program in which we were able to have around 50 mentors onboarded.
They say, "with great power comes great responsibility." Now that you are BSW's general secretary, do you feel an overwhelming pressure of responsibility? How do you deal with it?
On a very serious note, yes, I do feel that. It's like you are the head of a family of 37 people, and you have to be available for everyone. As a family, you have to grow and create an impact on other people, and you also have to ensure that as the family leader or organisation leader.
Whether the team is in the right state of mind or not, they are the ones who are doing the work for you. I can give them my vision, and if the people who have to implement the vision are not fine, then it will decrease the board's efficiency. Apart from this, I would not say pressure, but as I initially mentioned, I want to create an impact, so this role is perfect for me because the Board for Student Welfare is what we are. Most people don't know what the board does- people think there is only this mentorship, academic mentorship, and language mentorship. But there are lot of things which you see when you come into the board and we have to deal with it daily.. Being a part of BSW we have to be on the more empathetic side too, because Inorder to solve any problem we have to understand it first, and for that have to put ourselves in their shoes. And that keeps me motivated because it makes me feel that there are the people I have to work for and do something about. I mean, with great power comes great responsibility, but it is something that I really wanted to do, so I am really enjoying that I am able to give something back to the community.
Any final message for the audience?
It will be tough to give one final message, but I can tell you some important things that everyone here should know. The first thing is when someone is doing anything here in IITD, they should make sure that they do not do something that might complicate things for someone. I mean, there are some things that one does unintentionally on a lighter note, but they can hit deep inside the other person's mind. One should never do it or become a victim of something like that.
Secondly, don't stress too much about figuring out. There is always a rush about it, and to be honest no one has actually figured it out. If you have a lot of things to sort then you can not have all of them done at a time. Focus on one thing at a time, and everything will get sorted with time.
Apart from that, I'd tell students coming from varied backgrounds-financially, geographically, or otherwise-to never feel inferior by thinking a particular group is cooler or better than you. Leaving all things behind I would ask them to make this place their home and work hard to achieve wonders here.
Lastly, BSW is always available for you, so if you have an issue, go to a representative, secretary, or coordinator. You can even email me directly, and we'll try to help you out.

Having so many sports to choose from, when and how could you identify your sport?
Choosing basketball was an amusing incident. Initially, my inclination was towards cricket, but my elder brother used to play basketball. One day my maternal grandfather talked to the school coach and made me sit on the bus taking me to see my brother's match. This was my first encounter with competitive basketball. I started to meeting the coach often during the school hours and pursued basketball as my main sport. Another reason was the proximity of the basketball court compared to the cricket ground- I used to bunk classes all the time and play basketball xD.
What motivated you toward basketball, as we all know how time-consuming and tiring it can get? What are the other clubs you are active in, and how were you able to manage them along?
Playing basketball is something I look up to throughout the day, and I love the adrenaline rush while playing in the tournaments. I don't think I need specific motivation as I never felt ki "Shaam ko khelna jana padega and mehnat lagegi" lol.
I wanted to join some cultural clubs and was interested in learning some musical instruments, but I had my regular institute practice starting from the first year; hence I hardly got any time to involve myself much in other clubs.
What was the most memorable moment of your basketball journey?
We were at Spardha, IITBHU and had our semi-final match with MBM JODHPUR, we were trailing by 21 points at halftime; from there onwards we turned the one-sided match to a neck-to-neck one and finally, we won! It is one of the best matches of my life.
Apart from that, the moment when we won the InterIIT final against IIT Kharagpur was very memorable. KGP being the hosts, the court has a huge crowd gathered around, and a lot anti-cheering too :P. As soon as we heard the final whistle, all the IITD contingent members came running into the court. Absolutely a moment to cherish forever!
How has your time in BSA been like, and what motivated you to be "GSec"?
The first thing I wished to associate myself with was sports, specifically basketball. I have been a part of BSA since my first year and became the sports secretary of Kumaon hostel. Unfortunately, inter-hostels were not organized during my tenure because of the pandemic scenario. But we started preparing our hostel teams when we had a slight ray of hope in January. Although it seemed a bit hectic, it felt great to take responsibility and lead my hostel, to keep track of all the sportsmen in my hostel. When I came to know that InterIIT is being organized after two long years and that too on our own home ground, I decided to contribute more to the contingent, the board and the institute by being the General Secretary.
Most of the time, people are afraid to pursue sports because of low CG. What is your opinion in that regard? Is there a minimum CG criteria you suggest a person should have before dedicating time to sports?
A critical point I would like to highlight. There are many talented students in IITD. I have been fascinated by many students with a much more difficult branch than me but still have a CGPA above 9 and come to practice regularly. I tried to analyze what they do differently, but there was nothing much than a slight difference in time management. We shouldn't compare ourselves with others as we all have our own journeys and we know about our level in sports and academics and how much work we need to put in. We should focus more on doing what suits our goals the best. In my case, I never thought of the option of giving up as I like playing basketball even when we don't have practice. It is the sport that is important to me! There's no need to impose any CG criteria as everyone should be free to play any sport. Participating in sports on a regular basis benefits us greatly in managing time, fitness and also helps us to have a proper schedule.
Playing sports comes with a lot of unforgettable moments; I haven't represented the college in many tournaments because of the pandemic, but I can still recollect so many great memories. Nobody studies throughout the day, even if they are not playing a sport, and thus, you can always take out some time for them. Also, the institute team practices are put off a week before minors and majors, and you can skip the routine if you have a quiz therefore, there is sufficient time to study. Everyone's a little worried about placements from their first year itself but as time passes; they wonder whether it really mattered in the end as everyone manages to reach somewhere but the question is all about enjoying and loving the journey!
What is your opinion on the low participation of girls and pg students in sports? How will you increase their involvement?
Girls' participation has increased in the past few years and recently "Women Football" and other sporting events for girls have been promoted. In Sportech also we organized an informal event where we organized a friendly match with a NGO Club for women's football. Steps are being taken to include Women's Football in Inter-IIT, but because of pandemic, we can't conduct women's football this year; but we have convinced everyone to work it out once the situation gets normal as a lot of IITs showed interest in women's football. We would also need coaches and proper facilities for their sports; it is not that easy as we need to carry out reasonable procedures. I plan on implementing more measures to increase girls' participation at IIT Delhi in sports during my tenure.
As for PG participation, I feel that we are lacking in awareness. Some of them are not even aware that they have the opportunity to participate and represent IIT Delhi. They think that only the undergraduates are allowed to participate and represent IIT Delhi. Some are not on Instagram, others are not on the WhatsApp group, and some are not even allotted any hostel. Hence, we plan to conduct a meeting to introduce all the boards to the PG students. BSA will implement the same measures and publicize the board to the PG students.
In your manifesto, you mentioned that you "Ensured maximum involvement of the hostel residents in sports activities and introduced the freshers to the sports culture at IITD." What is the sports culture you talk about here?
The "sports culture" is the legacy of sports at IIT Delhi and the rivalries between the hostels here. In terms of sports, the transition from school level to the college level is amazing. The amount of exposure to sports at IITD, be it equipment, proper courts and fields or the level of the game, is not the same as school level. But many students are not aware about the opportunities available here.
As a sports secretary, it was my responsibility to motivate them and give them the push to play a sport, be it from scratch. I conducted regular meetings to introduce this sports culture to my fellow hostel mates, fascinating them by telling them stories of InterIIT and inter hostels.
NSO hours have not been allowed as of now; how is that going to work?
For NSO hours, the standard procedure is to go to the field, and your RFID card is scanned and kept there. The coach records the minimum hours they have to spend on the ground, and the same is put on the server. In COVID times, we couldn't conduct any offline events; hence NSO hours were given for running through an online app. Since we are returning to normal offline activities, we will reimplement the standard procedure.
We had offline practises/competitions after so long. Do you find any difference between the offline practices /competitions we had now vs before covid 19? If yes, how do you plan to restore it?
There is a considerable gap in offline events primarily due to monetary issues because we don't have that much budget as pre-covid times. Moreover, due to covid protocols, we couldn't invite many teams to Sportech and were restricted to accommodate only the NCR institutes. Only BITS Pilani and a few teams came from outside NCR, that too on their own accommodation. In contrast, we used to provide accommodation to all groups before covid in hostels or guest houses.
There has been a gap in team level as most seniors who played InterIITs have already graduated and couldn't pass on their experience. Hence, it is like starting from scratch in many of the sports. There has been a gap in competition and the competence of players. The same gap could be seen in practices, but since a few months have passed, the performance of the teams has improved.
How do you plan to tackle overcrowding at facilities like badminton courts, gyms, squash courts, etc.?
It is a known fact that there is an overcrowding issue. Mittal complex is paid and if that was not the case then people would have gone there in their leisure time without wearing proper attire and disturbed those who have passion for the game. The institute team can play for free; all others must pay fees and book slots in advance. This is efficient in controlling overcrowding.
Even in the SAC gym, there is not enough space to accommodate all the students. Hence a fee is charged, but still, there is overcrowding. For that, I recommend that the students should start using their hostel gyms. Most people go to SAC for the guidance of the trainer but they can take advice from seniors or watch Youtube videos instead.
Inter IIT is happening in Delhi this year, and after a halt of 2 years, What plans do you have in that regard?
Winning the InterIIT GC is the main goal for me and IIT Delhi absolutely has the potential to do that. In 2018 we won the GC, while in 2019, we were the runners-up. For this goal, I am working with the captains to scout new potential members for the team and carry out rigorous practices and make students work even harder. Many of the teams have a lot of freshers, thus, they need to step up their game which will require the guidance from their seniors and coaches. Organizing the InterIIT is not an easy task, but with the help of faculty, seniors and my team, I think we will be able to organize a grand festival this year! :)
What message would you like to give to the audience?
I suggest the students who are not playing any sport to come to the fields and try any sport at least once; all those who are in doubt whether they should continue playing every day and devoting time to the sport, I request you to please continue and contribute to the institute. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all the players- keep grinding and keep that fire ignited for some more time and we will lift that beautiful InterIIT trophy for sure! <3

SAC GSec - Kartik Khandelwal
BSP
Oct 21, 2022
10 min read
Updated:
Oct 31, 2022
Tell us something about yourself.
I am Kartik Raj Khandelwal. I am the General Secretary of the Student Affairs Council, SAC. I am a fourth-year Chemical Engineering student, and I am from Shivalik Hostel.
What was your first impression of the real IITD, the one you witnessed when you first came on campus? How was it different from the online IITD?
When I first came to IITD in 2019 after taking a drop in Kota, I was pretty much in the mindset that I had done three years of hard work. Now I will just go out there, meet new people, do new activities and, you know, be all
machau
, the best I can be.
But the journey was not like that when I came to IITD. I was just overwhelmed by the smartness of the people around me. People around me were doing so many good things ‚Äî and great things, actually ‚Äî and it was difficult to cope with all that; it was difficult to match their level.
I (
laughs
) wasn‚Äôt particularly good at anything; I always asked my mentor which club I should join and which society in IITD is The [Famous] One‚Ä¶, but he said to just explore. And I believe that‚Äôs good advice ‚Äî you try out different things and just find your favorite. You start by taking, let‚Äôs say, five things in the first year, and you ultimately converge to one or two in the second or third year.
It was different for me when I came back to campus after two years of COVID because, in those years, I had got time to work on myself. The team at Enactus was very supportive. I also got the opportunity to be a representative of Spic Macay, which helped me connect with the hostel students. I could take charge and be a leader, which instilled the confidence I lacked in my first year. I was not very proactive in various aspects in the first year, which changed after COVID.
Different people might have had different experiences with COVID. The good thing that happened to me was the confidence I got by working on myself. The journey from being Spic Macay representative to leading the SAC team could only occur because of the time I spent on myself during the lockdown. I got over the inhibitions I had. So that was how the campus was different for me; my approach overall and my mindset were different when I came back to campus.
Can you tell us about your experience as a Point of Contact between SAC and the IITD Alumni Association?
My journey with the IITD Alumni Association started very early in my tenure as a SAC secretary. I was their single PoC from SAC for various events they hoped to conduct throughout the year. I associated with them because I saw true potential in how they can help the student community and the benefit we could get from them.
My experience was, in a single word, great. I met alumni from 1970s and 1960s batches and alumni who had recently graduated two to three years back. I got to interact with them, learn their perspective, and know their ideas about how we can benefit the students.
One of the ideas, which is also mentioned in my manifesto, is launching a mentorship program for PG students. It was an idea given to me by an alumnus. He said PG students need guidance, and the alumni can help them given their plethora of opportunities.
It was great interacting with these alumni and also because of the events that we conducted. So we had an alumni fest which was conducted in hybrid mode in Dogra Hall around November-December. It was a completely new and different experience for me since I was organizing and managing the team single-handedly. I had to coordinate with the Gsecs  and club secretaries to organize the event. If anything went wrong, I was the one held responsible.
And one thing actually did go wrong. We had this hostel-level alumni interaction, but due to some reason, the alumni did not show up. Everyone was asking, ‚Äú
Kartik, alumni kahan hai? Koi bhi nahin aaya‚Ä¶.
‚Äù I am calling people [to ask them to] join the meet for some time, meet the students, but‚Ä¶ yeah.
It was a hell of a ride, to be honest. But in the final day event, which was supposed to be BRCA performances, a thousand people were watching the live stream. (
Nods
) That experience was very good for me.
What has your journey with SAC been like till now? Any highlights you would like to share?
SAC usually has a lot of work to do with BHM traditionally. But in the online setting, that was not the case. There were not many hostel-level, institute-level, or infrastructure-level initiatives to be planned. So we mainly focused on the technical side of projects ‚Äî building portals through which we could help the student community.
The Project Portal is a research opportunity portal where professors will list down any project or research opportunity they have on the portal, and students can apply on it. Right now, the process is that you have to mail the professor for the opportunity, sit in an interview, and get the role. But not all students get the opportunities, and not all the opportunities are being presented to the students. To streamline that entire process, we were working on the research opportunity portal.
What we had to do was get adequate security for the portal. Since we are formalizing all these things, we cannot let students from other institutes log in or hack into the portal. So we had to get Kerberos integration for the portal, and that was a very difficult task.
Collaborating with CSC, getting those approvals, getting those permissions ‚Äî it was a very long process. I had to come to campus specifically 2-3 times to talk to people at CSC to get approval. We had to bug them continuously to give the approval and speak with the Dean Academics and Dean Student Affairs. It took us about 3-4 months to get that Kerberos integration on the portal.
We are about to launch the Project Portal. We are getting professors on board and accumulating opportunities on the portal. Even after the integration, there were many technical glitches, but now we are ready to launch the portal. In a couple of months, we can see the portal working.
How does SAC play a role in integrating the PG students on campus? What are some PG initiatives that we can expect?
The number of PG students on campus is more than the number of UG students. PG is very divided ‚Äî there is Ph.D., M.Tech, MSR, M.Des., MBA; so we also need to give adequate representation to them. That is SAC‚Äôs vision for this year ‚Äî increasing the PG representation in SAC and eventually across all the boards. SAC also aims to get them involved in all the activities on campus, getting to know whatever issues they are facing and resolving them faster and quicker.
[One of] The PG initiatives that we are working on is getting water coolers and Wi-Fi in A-type Apartments, which is the married scholar apartments. Another PG initiative is launching two mentorship programs ‚Äî one in collaboration with BSW. We are currently formalizing the structure of it; how we can launch institute mentors similar to UG student mentors.
We are also launching an Alumni mentorship program for PG students in collaboration with the Alumni Association. We currently have 200 mentors on board. We are trying to get highly-specific industry-wise mentors for these PG students because PG works on very specific topics. Mentors who have worked on those topics can help them in their field. So we are working on getting those mentors [and] mapping to get those highly-specific mentors to the students.
These are some of the initiatives, and whatever issues come up, we work on resolving them as well.
Your manifesto highlights an initiative to restructure counseling services and reduce their stigma. It also focuses primarily on the inclusion of diversity on the campus, bringing together people from all languages and ethnicity. Can you elaborate on your vision for the same?
We are all aware of the fact that there is discrimination happening in IIT Delhi against a lot of students. It might be by fellow students, workers, or anyone around here. So, my vision is to sensitize the entire IIT Delhi community, from students to workers to guards to professors. We need to make them aware of what is right and wrong. Last year, we collaborated with TiSS and IGES to do these sensitization sessions for all the PoR holders. But now, we plan to expand it to the entire IIT Delhi community.
We are going to allow inter-hostel movements really soon, and that will be into the rooms as well, and in the common areas, there will be 24 x 7 common room access. This is a big step for the IIT Delhi community. For that, we need to get everyone on board [and] remove the stigma around it. We need to ensure that we are doing enough sensitization sessions and imparting that knowledge that this is not something which is wrong. It‚Äôs right, and in the modern society where we are living in, we have to accept this and move ahead with this.
We are currently having a new division, ‚ÄúDiversity and Inclusion,‚Äù in BSW, so in that, we will expand the horizons. We will have more dimensions to that division of BSW. They will have collaboration with IGES and ICC for dealing with any sort of discrimination that the students might be facing. Be it any remark which an authority has passed, be it any remark by a fellow student‚Ä¶ based on the kind of discrimination they have faced, they can report to the concerned authorities, and necessary action can be taken. So that is something which is being done currently.
Do alumni have a role to play in the working of SAC? If yes, how? If not, do the alumni-based initiatives aim to integrate the Alumni Body and the Student Body?
When you say alumni, they individually do not have any role to play in SAC activities. We, as SAC, want to be more inclusive of the Alumni bodies around the campus so as to strengthen the alumni-student bond and benefit from the prestigious alumni that we have. Secondly, there is going to be an Alumni board, which will be the seventh board. It will be included in SAC with the purpose of strengthening the relationship between alumni-student and planning more initiatives through which we can basically take the alumni‚Äôs help to benefit the students.
The lack of female/gender-neutral washrooms in the boys‚Äô hostels is a notable concern addressed in your manifesto. How do you plan to implement the same?
This was something which I came to know about when I saw a female worker in my hostel. She was using the Staff washroom, but that was not in a very good state. Also, in the hostels, there are no washrooms for female students to use. If there are guests, they have to use the SAC washroom because, apart from that, there is no female washroom anywhere on this [boy‚Äôs hostels‚Äô] side of the campus. That is where the idea originated, and I dived deep into this problem.
So the thing is that, with the inter-hostel movement also starting, we need to have gender-neutral as well as female washrooms in all the hostels, and similarly male washrooms and gender-neutral washrooms in the female hostels as well. So our initial survey showed that apart from one or two hostels, there is a common washroom or a female washroom there, but no gender-neutral washroom as of now.
It is not structurally possible to construct new washrooms in all the hostels. So what we are thinking of is constructing a big setup somewhere between Aravali and Karakoram, the empty places wherever there is a possibility. We will be constructing two-three sets of big washrooms on the campus. Not necessarily that all might be done this year, but we are hoping to at least get done with one of such washrooms. It will have a gender-neutral washroom, a female washroom, and a male washroom. These will be PwD friendly as well. It will be the entire setup and be somewhere in that locality only. So if any guest is coming, or there are a lot of students on this side of the campus, it is highly convenient for them. This is a big issue for us right now.
Do you feel there is still a need for arranging collaborations with vendors like OYO for PG student accommodation, given that new hostels have been constructed on the campus, namely Saptagiri and Dronagiri?
There are 10,000 students in IITD right now. . From what I know ‚Äî my figures might be a bit off ‚Äî but around 6000-7000 students have accommodation right now. So a large chunk of people reside outside the campus, and IIT Delhi wants to help them in any capacity they can. [IIT Delhi] wants to ease their experience if they are living outside. They should have that relief that okay, IIT Delhi is there for us. We will be working on providing them security, the helpline numbers, and in whatever capacity we can.
Now talking about the collaboration with vendors like OYO, upon discussion with various authorities, I got to know that collaboration was not very successful, and none of the stakeholders were very happy about it. The services provided by the vendors were not on point. So right now, we have to devise a new method for such collaboration, which we are currently working on. But meanwhile, what we are trying to do is help all the PG students who are residing outside the campus with the necessary facilities.
First of all, right now, the onboarding process is still going on. So once that is complete when everybody is there, either settled outside the campus or on the campus, we will do surveys to figure out how IIT Delhi can help them ‚Äî if they need security or cleaning services. Then we will figure out how the IIT Delhi community can help these students feel included on the campus at a hostel level. They are obviously very much a part of the institute. Still, at a hostel level, we can get them that sense of relief, that okay, IIT Delhi is doing something for us.
What are your vision and hopes for the SAC team this year?
My vision is currently highlighted in my manifesto. I want to make this campus more inclusive and more progressive in a lot of capacities. There is a lot of stigma around a lot of things. There are a lot of [cases of] people not being treated nicely. There is a lot of non-progressive behavior shown by students. My goal is to help improve that. That is my primary objective because I feel there is a lot of need in that area.
The second would be, as I also wrote in my manifesto, helping increase the alumni-student bond, getting whatever benefit we can from them, and making alumni more inclusive with the student community.
Lastly, if there is any other issue being highlighted to SAC or other student-specific issues, [I plan to] make the reporting process much easier for the students. They [should] know that they can talk to the SAC representative or some other concerned representative so that the problem can be resolved at a quicker pace. Once we get a problem, we take necessary and swift action for that. We are not stuck in administrative processes, getting delayed action, but acting very swiftly and quickly and helping students with whatever they are facing. Basically, a quicker resolution of the problems and an easier reporting process like this is something we want to get resolved.
And finally, I would like to clarify that Student Affairs Council and Student Activity Centre are different :)

BHM GSec - Divyanshu Bujethia
BSP
Oct 21, 2022
4 min read
Updated:
Oct 31, 2022
Hello sir, can you give a short introduction about yourself?
Hi, I am Divyanshu Bujethia, General Secretary for the Board of Hostel Management. I am currently in my fourth year in the Civil Engineering Branch, and I am a resident of Nilgiri Hostel.
Can you give us a quick overview of your first three years in your college, other than your BHM affiliations?
In my first year, I was quite an introverted kid initially. After spending some time in college, I took part in some extracurricular activities and started interacting with other students. I got to know more about the institute and explored campus life. My first involvements were in Cultural and Sports activities. I was a part of the hockey team of my hostel, and I was pretty active in Dramatics in my first year. Even when Covid came along in my second year, I continued to participate in Dramatics. Presently, I am associated with BHM only and not involved anywhere else.
You have been part of BHM for two years now. Can you tell us about your journey through the Board and some of your most memorable experiences?
Yes, I have been a part of the Board since my second year. I was the BHM representative for my hostel, followed by the position of Maintenance Secretary and now the General Secretary. It has been a fascinating journey. My tenure as the BHM rep started in the online semester; I got my first project under the Board for Covid workers- ever since, I have been learning something new in the Board, and it has been two years at this point. Post-pandemic, there have been many changes in the board's operations as we are doing it all offline now compared to working for the board online.
What is the action plan to shift back to a completely offline mode?
As I said, there had been a lot of alterations in the last year itself, but we, the Board, have not fully recovered from Covid yet. All the messes have just started going functional this semester. The budget is expected to significantly increase post Covid- we are overlooking the budget allocation process too. No one has seen BHM night for three years now, so we also plan to conduct some offline events this semester.
As a part of BHM, you have to interact with many people from outside campus. Any incident, negotiation or discussion that struck you as particularly interesting?
There have been a lot of interactions and negotiations with vendors and companies. Last year, I interacted with Nestle; we are on the verge of cracking a deal with them. There will be updates once we run trials. It was an exciting opportunity to talk to them and get them on board, and it was a fascinating experience overall. Once this plan is implemented, there will be QR-linked automated coffee distribution machines on campus. The maintenance and service of the machine will be outsourced to third-party vendors. It could be a huge thing once it starts running.
What are some valuable skills that you have learnt during your tenure?
Talking about skills I have learnt, the most important of them is time management- we have to give time to the Board while simultaneously managing academics and extracurricular activities. As a GSec, you have to work on many activities- there is a team of 52 people under you and all the hostels. Other than that, teamwork and knowledge of administrative functions have helped me greatly.
Your manifesto mentions the creation of online portals for BHM. How do you plan to work on that?
The thing about online portals is that people have been trying to work on them for a long time now. It is more or less the same idea that everyone has - the creation of online portals where the students can directly file problems, and we are primarily focused on that. I know it is hard for even CSC to dispense such a system accessible to all of IIT Delhi. So we plan to add one layer over the portal that caretakers already use and make it available to the students. The students could file a report, but the caretakers had the power to refute that. However, with this service available to the students, they can file complaints directly. We executed some mechanical implementations a while ago and made a physical model instead of a digital one. Even if we cannot work it out technically, we will implement that mechanical model with the help of secretaries from each hostel.
What are your ideas regarding increasing the outreach of BHM to students and beyond?
We are already working on increasing the outreach of the facilities of BHM to all students. For example- for the PG students who are not getting accommodation on campus, we are trying to help them by providing information on suitable nearby facilities. Students themselves are choosing these facilities; BSW is also looking into it. We are preparing a list and suggesting them to the PG students so they can access BHM help even outside campus.
As someone who has to constantly deal with a lot of fire from the administration, the students and third parties, how do you deal with the load and the stress?
I agree that the stress is indeed a lot to bear, especially now. For the first time in my life, after three years on campus, I had to switch off the read receipts on my phone. To deal with this, I try to manage my time effectively. I give a fixed amount of time to BHM work. After my classes, there is a specified time that I go to the office, interact with the Dean and the administration, look into ongoing projects, interact with the team and take updates. I believe the work and stress are manageable if you fix your time.
That was fun! That‚Äôs it from my side. Any parting advice that you would like to share with students?
For freshers, I would like to suggest that when you are coming into IITD, the following four years would be the best four years of your life. In your first year, work on your skills and explore everything in college, including PORs and extracurricular activities, that will also be highly constructive in your life.

Oct 31, 2022
Can you tell us about your first year at IITD? What things did you explore during your first year?
I was like most freshers on campus, who explored many different clubs and societies in their first year. In the first semester, I participated in many BRCA clubs however I realized by the end of the semester that I did not want to be a part of BRCA. During my second semester, I actively worked in Enactus and midway during this semester was when I actually tried to give BSP a shot.
What was your first impression about BSP, and what made you join BSP?
This is actually an interesting story. When my elder brother was a student at IIT Delhi, he used to bring home copies of Inquirer, Inception and Muse, so I was familiar with BSP work before joining IITD. When I read those magazines, I would feel astounded that they were actually produced by a student-run publication body. I had never witnessed any such body before and was really fascinated by it. I found it incredible that BSP was a body that could raise questions to any authority, something that other societies do not usually do, and this was what attracted me to BSP.
I have had a lot of ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô in BSP. During my freshmen year, I participated in Slam Poetry for the first time during Literati. I also tried out storytelling as well as wrote articles for the first time in Gazettale, BSP‚Äôs inter-hostel magazine-making competition
How has your experience been so far in working with BSP?
To sum it up in one word, I‚Äôd say my experience has been surreal. I had initially been recruited into BSP as a volunteer but was soon promoted to Journalist. While my tenure as a journalist went quite well, I feel that I completely fell in love with BSP when I became a Chief Editor and I became addicted to the Board.
I feel that BSP is a Board that really makes you think and question everything through the content that it publishes. I believe that the best part about BSP is that it is an independent body not involved in any politics. So we are free to cover any issues or wrongdoings on campus and hold any authority or board accountable without worrying about politics. Moreover, we also have the freedom to question not just students but also the administration, and this enables us to bring forth unbiased journalism and helps us connect to the student community.
Most of the work in BSP during the previous tenure was done online, but now as the institute shifts towards the complete offline mode of operation, what are your plans for dealing with the same?
I am personally very excited about BSP returning to the offline medium in this tenure. We have been scrolling through the magazines on our gadgets for the past couple of years but as writers and designers, watching them materialize as physical copies would be incredible.
Yet, BSP has amassed a large digital readership on social media in the past two years, and we would continue to post our work regularly through our channels. In addition, we plan to bring back the printed version of our magazines like Inquirer and Inception in this tenure. We are also exploring printing posters containing QR codes for our articles and posting them all around campus so that those who find the topic interesting can easily read the entire piece. Moreover, in 2019 we had BSP stalls or stands. These stands would be placed all over campus and would house copies of the magazines for everyone to read.
During your tenure, how much emphasis will BSP give to the new video journalism aspect? And what are your plans regarding the same?
BSP will give a lot of emphasis to video journalism in this tenure. I believe that, in general, the attention span of readers on social media has reduced significantly during the past two years. There is an inertia to scrolling multiple slides filled with text even when the issue is important, or the article is engaging. Many people might just scroll to the next post or reel or a different website. Thus, branching into video journalism will enable us to expand our viewership and engage more people.
We have already started working towards this, and even this series has a video journalism element to it. We would also be releasing video trailers for Inquirer and covering events on campus in the form of video journalism.
This is a new segment for all of us at BSP, and I believe it has a lot of potential and would be a really fun segment to explore.
You have talked about collaborating with other IIT's media bodies in your manifesto. Which media bodies would you like to collaborate with, and what are some pan-IIT issues/topics you believe would be suitable for the same?
I have gone through the Instagram channels of the media bodies of various IITs. For example, Vox from IIT Kanpur, Insights from IIT Bombay and The 5th Estate from IIT Madras are all really robust media bodies that put out exemplary work. I believe that each media body has its strengths and weaknesses, and there is a lot that we can learn from each other. This is one way in which a pan-IIT collaboration will be beneficial.
There is actually a WhatsApp group of the student heads of the media bodies of various IITs, and there have been discussions of collaboration on various topics and issues. One possibility is to do a comparative analysis of various issues across IITs. For example, we could cover topics like differences in academic or administrative policies like audit. IIT Madras has a robust feedback mechanism, whereas the feedback system of IIT Delhi is opaque and appears to be ineffective. IIT Kanpur and Bombay have already implemented cross-gender entry in hostels. We can also compare and contrast the strengths and shortcomings of the different placement cells of various IITs. These are some of the topics I believe and be covered under the pan-IIT collaboration.
You have addressed the need to increase inter-vertical interaction within the board. What made you feel that this step was necessary, and how do you plan to take this forward?
I have spent two years in BSP, first as a journalist and then as a chief editor. I do not recall interacting freely with the technical editors during my tenure as a journalist. It was as though there were two exclusive segments within the Board, the journalists and the technical editors. I also did not have much communication with the design chief editors. There was some friction between the two segments, which hindered the cross-communication of design and writing ideas. Even as a Chief Editor, I noticed that the team of journalists and designers did not feel comfortable approaching a chief editor of the other vertical.
There was also a misconception within the team that BSP work involves 80% contribution of the writers and only 20% contribution of the designers. This is not true because design is a crucial and essential impact of BSP work. Design is what attracts readers to our articles. Many people would not read our articles if they were not published in an attractive and presentable format, something which the designers provide.
Inter-vertical interaction will be extremely beneficial in improving the working of the Board. For instance, this year in Gazettale, we used to have full team meetings with both the writers and the designers. This allowed everyone to put their minds together on all aspects of each piece, and together, we came up with incredible ideas for content and design. This kind of free flow of ideas is essential for any team.
To increase interaction, we have planned to include the technical editors and web editors in the content and ideation meetings for all articles. Earlier, the designers were assigned to design the articles only after the content was ready. So they felt that they weren't a part of the project. Making them a part of the project from the beginning will make them feel included and would bring out new ideas and perspectives.
BSP is a Board that has a wide reader base and outreach. How do you think this platform can be utilised to promote the interests of the IITD community?
BSP has been using its platform and readership to promote the interests of the IITD community for many years now. For example, last year, we published a two-part series called Pain which dealt with the dreadful issue of sexual harassment in IIT Delhi. Sexual harassment is one such issue which is never talked about openly and only discussed in hushed voices. When BSP published the article, I remember a few of my male friends approached me and expressed that they were completely unaware that such incidents were taking place on campus. We conducted a survey as a part of the series, and I was shattered by reading about the experiences that some women have had in the institute. After that, I felt responsible for doing that article to raise awareness about the menace and prevalence of harassment in IIT Delhi and initiate conversations about it. The inclusivity series was another such series I felt extremely strongly about. We had two articles in the series, the LGBTQ+ article and women in sports and reading the survey responses for the LGBTQ+ article was really disheartening.
I believe that while other Boards do amazing work and also tackle these issues at their level, it is BSP which has not just the responsibility but also the ability to raise these issues and initiate discussions and conversations around them. As a student publication body, BSP has the power to question all wrongdoers and put forth these issues in front of the entire IIT Delhi community.
What has been the most memorable incident you can recall while working as a journalist or a chief editor?
Last year, BSP covered how the provision for I-grade was being misused during the online semesters. Many students were allegedly using this provision to forgo the examinations of some courses and appear for them at a later stage. Students were badgering doctors to issue medical certificates by faking illnesses. Moreover, this crowd was affecting the students as well as some senior citizens who were genuinely sick and needed a doctor‚Äôs attention. When I went to the IITD hospital, there was a long queue of students there, and I had to wait for 2 hours just to get a five-minute checkup. The doctor even asked me if I had a genuine illness or just wanted a medical certificate.
After this incident, I messaged on the BSP group about covering this issue, and within a couple of hours, BSP journalists were on the scene talking to doctors, hospital staff and students regarding the same and the article was released within 3-4 days.
Any final thoughts or messages that you would like to share with the readers?
I do have a message for the readers. While BSP endeavours to identify and cover all the major events, happenings and issues on campus, there might be certain topics that the BSP team is not aware of. So I would urge everyone to approach any BSP team member about any issue or concern that they would like us to cover. If you think there is any event or wrongdoing in the institute that BSP has not covered or if you have any feedback about our work, you can contact any team member you know or even reach us on our Instagram ID.
In addition, BSP has a lot of exciting projects in the works, from video journalism to creative segments, we have something for everyone, and you should look really forward to it.

BRCA GSec - Nishant Bansal
BSP
Oct 21, 2022
5 min read
Updated:
Oct 31, 2022
What was your first impression of BRCA?
When I came to IITD, I was pretty clueless about the college. Most of my friends had an idea about the numerous boards and the activities they conducted but I did not have much exposure to this culture. When my hostel representatives introduced us to the plethora of clubs, I felt the need to take part and engage in them. I tried out various cultural and sports activities, and developed an interest in a few of them, like PFC.
What is the best piece of advice you have ever received?
The best piece of advice I've ever received is that you should always give your best, even if you're hesitant in trying out something new. When I was the cultural secretary of my hostel or the PFC representative, I always encouraged freshers to take part in various competitions and try out different clubs, even if they didn't have much exposure in that field. You have to dedicate some time, but eventually, this is what will help you figure out your interests and chalk your future. And more importantly, you'll never carry the regrets of not trying something out.
What encouraged you to be a part of BRCA?
I first became involved in the activities of BRCA because one of my hostel reps encouraged me to take part in an event. It was made compulsory to attend the first workshop for every club, to acquaint the freshers with the activities, hostel events and the club seniors. I gradually took part in numerous events and got a taste of all the clubs. The first workshop I attended was of the photography and films club (PFC), and we learnt about the basics of mobile photography. I enjoyed the event a lot, and thought this was a club I could be a part of.
You have been a PFC representative, the cultural secretary, the Director of PFC and also a Creative coordinator for Rendezvous. So how was your journey with BRCA, and when did you realise that you could lead the board?
My journey with BRCA has been great, and at every point of time I have learnt something new. We managed to pull off tasks that we never thought we could. For example, I was part of the creative team of Rendezvous 2022, and we had to create numerous posters and graphics. The entire team was working hard, and we finally managed to pull it off. It was a constant learning experience and I gained a lot from it. In fact, life at IIT Delhi is all about dealing with the workload, so taking part in these activities teaches us to deal with the pressures of life and how to manage time well. That's what BRCA is all about; it teaches us that everything is possible if we try hard enough. Somewhere along the lines, my leadership skills improved and I felt that I could lead the board by being the General Secretary.
What is BRCA doing on the PG representation front?
PG representation is an issue that every board has to work on. BRCA is planning to hold a PG orientation, which is a new initiative. It would be scheduled in August, and the main objective would be to increase the number of PG representatives and panel members in clubs. It would help the PG students connect more with the IITD culture and take part in more activities. We aim to organize 2-3 events specially for PG students, which would be focused on pushing forward their interaction and participation. Moreover, for involving any student into the board, it is necessary to organize some informal events and recreational activities to increase interest and enthusiasm. After this, we can go ahead with inter-hostel events and other competitions.
You mentioned in your manifesto that you plan to make Rendezvous a year-long event, with non-club activities conducted periodically. Why did you feel the need to do so, and what is your action plan regarding the same?
Currently, there is a hype about rendezvous a few months prior to the event, and it dies down after the fest. So if we conduct non-club specific activities periodically throughout the year under the banner of Rendezvous, we can keep the enthusiasm and the hype high. This project is still in the ideation stage, and we need to finalize the sponsors, type of events etc. By conducting these generic cultural events, we can also include the cultural secretaries of the hostels, who would take the lead. There are many particular points of interest in Rendezvous that can be extrapolated all year long. Moreover, this would be a great way to increase PG representation too, and familiarize them with BRCA.
Certain BRCA clubs like the literary or the music club are usually able to attract participation only from those who are already well-versed in the activity (like poets or writers for the lit club). How can we increase participation among the students and encourage them to explore these fields?
The recreational activities we plan to conduct will have a huge effect on this. For example, this year, we conducted By the Chai, which was a collaboration between the music and the lit club. These activities reveal the true potential of the clubs. The students get a chance to view brilliant performances, and the natural tendency is to take a seat and spectate. Since it's an informal event, there would not be any judging. This would encourage students to go ahead and participate, irrespective of their experience in the same. Students can just go and sing a song, even if they've never done so on stage before. Although, we do have to work more on increasing participation in these niche areas. For those who are not well versed with the activities of the club, or for those who are hesitant, we need to carefully curate events for the smooth transition of them into these clubs.
This year, IITD shifted from the online to the offline mode. What does that mean for BRCA and what new initiatives would this change bring about?
That's the best part this year, and this is how BRCA can show its true potential. Events that were conducted in the online mode so far, like the Tour of Stalls would be held offline. Moreover, the main events in BRCA night would be offline, and it would show the freshers the legacy of these clubs. Even Rendezvous would be held completely offline, and this would enable us to cross many milestones and unlock the huge potential of BRCA.
Any final message for the readers?
Again, similar to the best advice I've ever received, never be hesitant to try anything. If you need any help, reach out to your points of contact. The hostel reps, club secretaries and representatives and cultural secretaries would definitely be willing to help. You can even reach out to me if you need anything. Never be afraid to try something new, and don't let your insecurities stop you from exploring. If you never try, you'll never get to know more about various fields.

Banwari Bhaiya: The Man Behind the Counter

Interview Of Banwari Ji. Full Video On Youtube.
My Journey as a Juice Vendor at IIT Delhi
I am originally from the holy city of Mathura, UP, and I've been selling juices in Delhi for the last 21 years. When I first considered setting up a shop in Delhi, I found the area unsuitable due to the ruckus and caste-based tensions. I started my career at IIT Delhi in the staff canteen, where I worked for six years. It was there that I met Raj Meena, the Kumaon House Secretary at the time, who became a regular customer and suggested I set up shop at Kumaon Hostel. Despite my initial hesitations about the bureaucratic process, Raj helped me with the necessary paperwork, including food licensing, GST registration,¬†etc.
My Daily Routine
My shop operates from 9 am to 4 am. My day begins with cleaning, washing fruits, and preparing Chai. I spend 14 hours at the shop, while my staff manages the chores for the remaining 6 hours. My family, including my wife and three daughters, lives in Badarpur, and I make round trips on alternate days to buy fresh fruit stock from Okhla. My parents also reside in Badarpur, while I have a temporary residence in Ber Sarai.
Seasonal Sales and Staffing
Sales at my shop fluctuate with the seasons. During summer, mango juice sales soar, necessitating a larger workforce. Typically, I employ two staff members during the off-season, increasing to three during peak times.
The Impact of Covid-19
The onset of the Covid-19 lockdown was particularly challenging for me. I had opened my new shop for just 1 day on March 15, 2020, when the lockdown was announced. However, IIT Delhi provided regular monetary support during these tough times, which was greatly¬†appreciated.
Technological Advancements
The introduction of UPI has significantly changed the way I conduct business. Previously, managing currency notes involved maintaining a registry and giving change, which was cumbersome during peak times. UPI has streamlined transactions, though occasional technical issues do arise.
Expanding Beyond Kumaon Hostel
I've ventured beyond my regular spot by setting up a juice stall during dinner at Kumaon Mess every Friday, where my popular Oreo shake is a hit. I've received positive feedback when selling outside the hostel but have not yet secured a contractual basis for expansion.
Building Relationships
Over the years, I've built strong relationships with my customers, many of whom consider me family. Alumni often visit me when they return to campus, and I maintain connections with former house secretaries, who keep in touch via phone.
Sports and Student Elections
The sports culture at IITD boosts my business, especially after matches when teams visit my shop. Student elections also provide a temporary increase in sales when candidates bring their supporters for parties.
Challenges and Aspirations
One of the significant challenges I face is the pricing, which has remained constant since the Covid-19 period. Adjusting prices could risk losing the shop's tender, but I believe they should be revised. Despite these challenges, I express a deep affection for IITD, citing the safety, cleanliness, and timely payments as reasons why I would not want to leave. However, my future at IITD depends on administrative decisions, and I aim to maintain the quality for which I am known.

Sandwiches and Tea with Kamala Aunty
BSP
Mar 28
4 min read
Interview with Kamala Aunty. Full video on Youtube.
My family and I arrived in Delhi in 1980 in search of job opportunities. We hail from the serene hill station Ranikhet, near Nainital in Uttarakhand. We still miss our hometown immensely, and we visit it during the summer breaks of May and June.¬† I have a son who works here at IIT Delhi in Kumaon Hostel. He cannot speak or hear, but he diligently manages his duties in the mess. My younger son works in Gurgaon, and my daughters are married. It's the five of us at home: my two sons, two daughters-in-law, and myself.
My husband started this SBI canteen in IIT Delhi in 1998, so we have been here for more than 25 years, and I have grown to fall in love with this place. The shop used to be situated in the front where the ATM now stands. This shop location is somewhat conspicuous, but since it primarily started as an SBI staff canteen, it needs to be close to the bank. My husband passed away some years back, and I have been taking care of the shop ever since then. When I first started working here, I used to burst into tears, wondering how I would manage everything on my own. Slowly and steadily, I found my place here. All the students here are immensely polite, and the overall environment is cheery.
‚ÄúBahut pyaar milta hai, paisa hi sabkuch nahi hota hai.‚Äù
My day starts at 5 am, when I wake up and complete my morning chores, bathe and do pooja. I spend around 2 hours listening to bhajans, lost in prayer and devotion to god. I've come to realise that this is one of my favourite parts of the day. Earlier, I used to like listening to songs, but as I've grown older, I've shifted from songs to bhajans, which bring me comfort and peace. I reach campus around 8-8:30 am, with students waiting for their morning tea and sandwiches (read: perfect breakfast :) ). I unpack the milk, sandwiches, patties and everything else and arrange everything neatly. I get these items from a vendor. Amidst the daily tasks, I settle into the rhythm of the day. My busiest shift, but also one of my favourite times of the day, is around 11:30-12 pm when students and professors disperse for their lunch break and come pouring into my snacks shop. Around 2 pm, my elder son comes to help me out after his shift at Kumaon ends. His shift starts very early, at around 6 am in the morning, so I ask him to go home and rest after a while.
The work here doesn't tire me, and if I ever feel overwhelmed, the sweet regulars help me out a bit. Sometimes, when I step away to serve tea to the SBI staff, students even place their sandwiches on the grill themselves. They're very trustworthy and reliable. If I'm busy with another task while making tea, I jokingly ask the students to keep an eye on it. Over time, I have become familiar with the students and have developed a special bond with them. When the tea is still brewing and the students are in a hurry, sometimes I even jokingly scold the older students, saying, "Wait, the tea is still brewing. Slow down!" It never feels like work here; it feels like home. I leave campus to go to my house via metro at around 6 in the evening.
People often tell me to retire because of my age, but I tell them that until my limbs and body support me, I don't mind working here. Interacting with people here brings me joy, and I have fostered many unique connections over the years. I do not like sitting idly at home; I feel sick. Because of this shop, I've placed myself into a nice routine here, and it keeps my body active and healthy. I like to wake up at 5 am every day, even when I'm not working.
Talking about lockdown, it was a very hard time for our family. Both my sons were out of jobs because of it, and our primary source of livelihood, this shop, also had to be closed. However, the bank and IIT officials were immensely helpful to us, emotionally and financially. The officials helped me like a brother helps their sister, and I will never be able to forget their gracious generosity.
Sometimes, old bank employees and students who graduated long ago come back to visit me. If they have some work on campus, they make sure to stop by. It warms my heart to see them prosper and go places. A few weeks back, an old PhD student who became a professor returned to visit me and brought me a saree and a box of sweets. I have lots of students like that. Another student, his name is Shyam, got me a beautiful purse. When he went outside for work, he said, "Ek purse ma ke liya laya hu aur ek aapke liye." It has been many years, but the purse is so precious to me that I have kept it safe in my house and have never used it. It's not about the things; it is about the gestures. I've realised that the real treasure of life lies not in money but in the priceless connections you build with those around you.
Students celebrate my birthday wonderfully here (if you are wondering, it's on 20th January:)). Last time around, they surprised me with a cake, bringing it to the shop, and we had a small cake-cutting ceremony. Some students would often ask about my birthday, but I kept denying it, and they would playfully pretend to be upset when I didn't tell them when it was.
I think of the students here as my children. When people come to this shop, whisked away from the hustle-bustle of daily lives, they often tell me that they find peace (read: sukoon) here. Just yesterday, a student came to the shop, and when I offered him tea, he smiled and replied that he had just come to sit down and rest here. I am profoundly grateful to work here, surrounded by people who love and respect me, and whom I love and cherish in return.

Charan Bhaiya - Holistic Night Mess
BSP
Sep 20, 2022
4 min read
I came to IIT at a very young age, when I was about 14. Many people from my village used to go to Delhi to find work, so there was a desire inside me too to go to Delhi. Thus the first time I came to Delhi was by running off from my school.
During my initial phase at Delhi, I used to sit around with people and help them out in something or the other and eventually managed to win their confidence. Finally, I found a job in a juice corner inside IIT Delhi‚Äôs campus. Interestingly the name of that juice corner too was ‚ÄúHolistics‚Äù. It was beside the Nalanda ground. I have always believed that trust is most important, and I always focus on gaining people's trust. My current boss trusts me immensely too. He owns various canteens, and the business and management of Holistics he has wholly entrusted to my care.
After the juice shop, I worked in canteens and did some other jobs intending to gather experience and knowledge from everywhere. Finally, I landed in the Jwalamukhi Night mess, where I worked for close to 16 years before it had to be closed during the lockdown. The person who owned that night mess was the same person who owns this current Holistics.
Having lived and worked amidst students from the start, I really cherish the experience. Working amidst kids gives me happiness. In fact, now I feel weird if I have to work somewhere outside schools and colleges, that is, among grown-ups. All these children are almost like my friends now, which makes working so much easier. Understanding their feelings, what they want to eat, and making the food akin to their taste gives me great joy. The kids open their hearts to me and tell me how they want particular things to be made. So I strive to make it as they like and really enjoy the process.
When the Jwala night mess was shut down, I returned to my native home in Nepal, which is 300-400 km from here. There I put my time and effort into organic farming, tending my cattle and setting up a poultry farm.
Then when the pandemic died down, the person who owned the Jwalamukhi night mess called me back, saying that they were opening a new mess in Aravali. So I left my village and came back here to IIT. On coming back, I helped to set up Holistics here. The Aravali night mess had also been closed during the pandemic, and Holistics was coming up in place of it. In the place where the Jwalamukhi night mess used to be, there is now a YULU stand.
Fortunately, Holistics has been a big hit, and many students flock here every day, and I am delighted. This place is actually better than Jwalamukhi, the location being more hygienic and spacious. The establishment at Jwalamukhi was a temporary one, made by erecting tin structures. Though it was also very popular and there was never a dearth of students there either.
" ‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§§‡•ã ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§¨‡•ã‡§π‡§§ like ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ | ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§™‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à | ‡§ï‡•ã‡§á ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ, ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§ú‡§ó‡§π ‡§π‡•à | ‡§ê‡§∏‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡§π ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§∏‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á | ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á ‡•õ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à | ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§ö‡•Ä‡•õ ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§≠‡§á‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ö‡•Ä‡•õ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡•ã ‡§†‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã | ‡§∏‡§≤‡§æ‡§π ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à | ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§â‡§®‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§≤‡§æ‡§π ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§§‡•á ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à "
I have also worked outside IIT, but nowhere else do I get the kind of environment I get here. The students being an educated community, give me a lot of love and respect. This isn't always the case outside IIT. I have worked in a few markets and in Gurgaon too, but I don't get the same kind of respect there. People pick fights over small matters, and I don't feel good there. I can earn money there as well, but one doesn't look only for money in their job. If I am working hard, I want to be treated with the respect I deserve, and I feel that that respect is what I get at IIT, which makes working here unique and fun.
I have spent my whole life here at IIT and still enjoy each day and wish that whatever work I get to do, I do inside this campus. No one knows what will happen in the future. I am a man with a temporary kind of life, never thinking too much about the future. No one knew that Covid would happen, but it did, so I don't fret too much over the future. Whatever is destined to happen will happen. So, all in all, I am working, and all is going well. I don't care whether I am working for someone else, with someone, or if it is someone else‚Äôs work. I consider all work to be my own work when I am working. I am being paid justly for whatever I do and have been able to lead a decent life and provide for a family, and I am content. The only thing is that what will happen in the future is uncertain. ‚Äú‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§® ‡§§‡•ã ‡§∞‡•ã‡•õ ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•á ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è‡§ó‡§æ, ‡§¨‡•ù‡•á‡§ó‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‚Äù. However, things are good now, much better than ever, which is satisfying enough for me.

How has the ‚Äúnew-normal‚Äù treated you?
Very well, excellent, in fact. My schedule is twice as hectic as before, I am stuck to my chair for the most part of the day. And I do get to accept many more lecture invitations- four times as many as I used to. I see it as an opportunity,  that I have been given an excellent push; a push in the right direction.
Post-COVID, all my students are now just-a-click away. Formerly, there were inhibitions and hesitations amongst them to come and meet me or to talk to me; but now I get to talk to a lot of students who just drop me a message and we have a good conversation.
While we know about your journey at a broad level from BITS Pilani to IISc and then to IIT Delhi, tell us about some key turning points for you?
What have been some of the defining/turning moments in your life?
That is a very difficult question actually. The profession I chose is a profession that favours extroverts and I am a private type of person. I am never happier than when I am with my books, or in a library or doing what I like. So, being forced to go out and enjoy teaching has been a turning moment in life for me. Even going to a class and talking and interacting with 300 students and then feeling a sense of connection developing with my students has definitely been a turning moment in life for me.
What are some of your hobbies that you enjoy indulging in?
I have a set of very personal and very intense hobbies. I used to teach sculpture, clay modeling, batik, and wax modeling. I still like doing a lot of these things whenever I find time. I paint, I paint Madhubani, write and read books. Almost all my hobbies in life have been single man hobbies. I play the hawaiian guitar as well. I mostly play Hindustani classical music, because, though I like Mozart, Strauss and Bach, I do not formally understand or read Western music.
On your webpage you thank Prof. S.C.Sahasrabuddhe of IIT Bombay for 15 minutes of his time that changed your life. I am curious to know what happened in those 15 minutes.
When I had just joined IIT Delhi, I had all the arrogance of somebody who had had a first-class academic career in top-class institutes and had been told by their supervisor that ‚ÄúThis is what the world is coming to in 20 years‚Äù. Like most of you believe that if you know ‚ÄòMachine Learning‚Äô, that‚Äôs it; you don‚Äôt need to know anything else in the world. There were people like that in my life too, who told me that in 20-years ‚Äòthis‚Äô is all you would need.
I came to IIT Delhi as an Optical Communications Person- thinking that everything in the next 30 years would be going my way.
Prof. Sahasrabuddhe had come to speak at a conference (NCC). Professor S.D. Joshi asked me if I could go to Professor Sahasrabuddhe‚Äôs ongoing session and let him know that it was time to wind up the lecture because we were late for lunch. I went there, and he was talking about ‚ÄòTelecom Protocols‚Äô and robbed-bit signaling. I figured it would be very brash of me to just interrupt him and ask him to cut short his lecture for lunch. So I just sat down in the last row, and listened to what he was talking about.
In those few minutes, I turned from an Optics-only person to a Telecom-aware person. All because, I appreciated what he was trying to say instead of saying that ‚ÄúTelecom was nothing but Optics‚Äù- which is the sort of arrogant vision I would have normally subscribed to.
I do trace the foundation of my association with the Bharti School of Telecom back to that lecture. Since then, I have often told Professor Sahasrabuddhe that he was very instrumental in something which happened to me, but being the polite person that he is, he never enquired why.
Everybody has an ‚Äòaha‚Äô moment, mine may have been late in coming, but thank God it did !
More on the previous question, you have also thanked
Sri Bala Mukunda Panda
for teaching you Sanskrit despite it not being a part of your School Curriculum. What led you to study this subject?
In my entire childhood, my parents never ever forced me to study. My father, in one of his rare excursions into my study room, came and asked me about the subjects I was studying then. This was about in class 7th or 8th. So, I told him the subjects I was studying and he was surprised to find that I was not being taught Sanskrit at school. He said that I must learn Sanskrit whether or not I had it as a subject being taught at school or not. I think I was the only student in my class who had a tuition master coming at home, seven days a week to teach me Sanskrit. My mother kept telling my father that I had other important things to do like Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics but my father never budged. ‚ÄúNo, he must learn Sanskrit. How can he go into the world without Sanskrit ?‚Äù, he used to say. And honestly, learning Sanskrit was fun. And also, the man my father chose to teach me Sanskrit (Shri B.M.Panda) was a peculiar man. He said let's not ‚Äòlearn‚Äô Sanskrit, let's just read the
Panchatantra
and in Sanskrit.
Your LinkedIn profile shows you as a trained listener. Now that is something new that most of us have never heard of. What does a trained listener do? And how has your experience as a trained listener been?
A trained listener is supposed to talk with people having problems. For eg with people having anxiety problems, neurosis, and all sorts of other problems. Talking from a factual point, there are actually many types of training you can undergo involving all sorts of things. My expertise is listening to the teenage segment.
Being a listener is somewhat challenging. Whenever you start a conversation with someone who is disturbed, there is a certain way you have to deal with it. You cannot ask him/her certain questions. You have to let the words come from the other side. You have to be extremely careful, because the person on the other side can be suicidal, or depressed. So, unless you are certified, you are not allowed to talk. You have to know how to keep the confidence because the person on the other side would be talking about very very intimate issues and problems. So that is what a listener does.
Being a listener has taught me to empathise. It has taught me to walk a very fine line between what my students call as dictatorial and understanding. I can come across like a tyrant in class, but I also have students who come and spend 4-5 hours in my office, keeping on talking about problems which come from. They say that they are talking to someone about the problem for the first time.
This has not at all been an easy experience for me because at a personal level, I have always been a very private and introspective person.
Life has become a hustle for most undergrads, there is always a race- a race for assignments, exams, internships, projects. What is your take on this?
Yes, because you don‚Äôt like to slow down. You don‚Äôt lie down on the lawn on Sunday afternoons to spend two hours looking up at the sky. You will not do it at home, you wouldn‚Äôt speak to your grandmother, you will not listen to her talk away for hours. You would rather be doing Machine Learning projects, reading something on the web or applying to universities abroad. You would rather use Whatsapp than to sit by yourself for 3 hours without speaking, the attitude of zen is very important. When you are 50, you will have to pay through your nose to go to a ‚Äòretreat‚Äô where they will make you do much the same thing.
But I‚Äôll tell you this, when you hit 90 and look back at what has been important in your life, you will find those 15-minutes spent with your father, just sitting silently while he is reading the newspaper, were worth a lot -- they were the really golden moments of memory.
There are very few golden moments, and you need to be able to recognise when they come and go.
I manufacture my golden moments. Like it is 17:01 right now, at around 17:30, there is a pair of peacocks, who will stand outside my door and start vocalising because they expect me to come and feed them. Similarly, I have parrots, who have a schedule of visits. All these are my ways of slowing down time.
All those multi-million projects and inter-university programmes are important, but so are my parrots, and my peacocks.
I think I am funny that way, because I give my garden the same loving attention that I give to my PhD students.
The kind of rat-race we have today, was the situation similar during your college days?
That is a question you have to ask rats. If you were not a rat, you wouldn‚Äôt know that at all. I have never been a rat; never entered the labyrinth actually. Nobody ever forced me to do anything. Nobody told me to be an Engineer. I wanted to take up History, could have done English,-- and I almost took up Physics. I still love to visit museums, whichever city I am in.
The rat-race never touched me; nobody ever told me that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do this‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt study at this institute‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get this degree‚Äù, I would be unhappy or out of a job or sad or anything. People said if you do the right things, the right things will happen  and they will be the right things for you, the things you will be happy with.
If you fix your target to be something like ‚ÄúUnless you are a software engineer for XYZ Company you will be unhappy‚Äù you will find yourself always shooting for it. But if someone tells you, ‚ÄúDo you want to become a Geography teacher at School, you will be very happy‚Äù, and you become a Geography teacher, and you will think you did a wonderful thing and your parents are applauding; I don‚Äôt think you would ever know what it means to miss working as a Computer Engineer for XYZ Company.
My parents always said that whatever you do, it is fine, whatever happens therefore, is fine too.
You have been at IIT Delhi for a long time,do you see any changes in the undergraduates today vis-a-vis that of your time?
They are only getting better I think, more smart.
I am surprised at how vulnerable your generation is, even though you pretend to be encased in nickel-vanadium steel. You are actually pretty brittle inside. I think my generation was a ‚Äòsoftie‚Äô generation, we were soft outside and soft inside- like gelatin. But you guys are like eggshells, you seem very hard but are actually very crumbly.
Most of the students I see are victims of their ranks in JEE. What else can I do if I am rank 20 in JEE- nothing but discipline ‚ÄòX‚Äô in institute Y. It is as if the JEE Rank 1 cannot pursue Leather Engineering from Calcutta; of course he can but that‚Äôs not what the world allows him to do. The world blinkers him, whitewashes him and mind washes him till he can only do discipline X. More than the ranking system, all our Chachus, Mamas and parents and neighbours know exactly which IIT is better than which IIT, and how, and for what.  Even I don't know how these rankings come about, even that IIT may notknow but our neighbours know it all.
What are your takes on the online semester and the classes happening online?
When we are teaching in class even in online mode, we are actually not away from you. Even in the physical class, we could have been just 6 metres apart physically. But, mentally the students could be miles away from us. With the lectures being recorded and made available to students, learning has definitely become better for certain students.
At the same time, I quite like the freedom that the online mode of teaching gives me. For instance, take the case of the laboratory course I am taking this semester. It is a course of about 200 undergraduate students. Normally, there would be five sessions per week and each session would have been taken by a different professor. I would only have had to interact with some 30-40 students taking the lab on my assigned day. I would see the other 160 students only when the time of grading used to come around. But now, it's just me. I am able to control students much better when they start complaining about certain course policies. There is nobody else to moderate it now. Earlier, the screaming used to persist for five lab sessions which is now being dealt in just one. It now just takes one person to withstand that onslaught of student feedback. Alone, I can just hold the forte against two hundred students very successfully, but with colleagues I could not. So, the online semester does seem to be treating me very well in this regard.
That‚Äôs it from our end, would you like to leave a message for our readers?
You know the difference between a horse and a mule? A horse has blinkers on and it is focused on running a certain amount of distance in a certain amount of time. A mule is a much more powerful and free spirited animal. It is considered a stupid animal because it carries loads far in excess of what it should. But when Steve Jobs said ‚ÄúStay Hungry, stay foolish‚Äù, he was talking about the mule- not the horse.
I have never really believed in the concept of ‚Äòstudying hard‚Äô. I have never ever ‚Äòstudied hard‚Äô in my life. That is a very big problem with me that I cannot bring myself  to agree with my colleagues when they say he/she is a very studious person. I keep on asking if he/she is having fun or not and that is not a question that my colleagues take seriously.
When I see students complaining of having learnt nothing new in ELL100, of not seeing the meaning of what is being taught in the course, that is when my antennae just go up and I see that here is somebody who is not having fun. There is no point in studying if you‚Äôre not having fun. And this has nothing to do with how hard one is studying or the number of hours one is studying. If you learn how to have that fun, you basically don‚Äôt need a teacher. You become self driven, just like Eklavya. That is something I just don‚Äôt see much of in my students. My students keep groaning about credits, that 1.5 credits mean 3 hours a week, and you have taken 15 minutes extra -- I can‚Äôt understand this concept, because for me it‚Äôs just an obsession, not just a course to study actually. I have to be obsessed with a subject to study. I would encourage a student to study for fun, to enjoy and appreciate the beauty of what is being taught. To not restrict yourselves to the domains of the coursework and rather be free spirited and explore whatever interests you. As Mark Twain said, ‚ÄúNever let school interfere with your education‚Äù.

I came to Delhi 9 years back, from Kalahandi, Odisha with few of my villagers in search of livelihood. My youngest son was only two months old when my husband left us. I had to take care of my four kids alone.
With such young children, I couldn't work, I had to borrow and feed them. When my son just started walking I left for Delhi. Vidhyanchal Hostel was under construction at that time. I remember carrying loads of bricks on my head with my son tied around my chest. When the work at Vidhyanchal got over, the whole staff including the people from my village shifted to a different place and left us behind. My son was crying and roaming around in search of them when he saw me he ran into my arms and said: ‚ÄúMaa they left, they didn‚Äôt take us along.‚Äù
I couldn‚Äôt rent a room, after many requests one family let us stay with them, I used to cook for them and did other chores. Due to less space, I had to sleep on the floor for a long time. And then with some help, I got work as a cleaner in the Main Building with a salary of Rs 6000. I‚Äôve been doing the same work since then in different parts of the campus.
There‚Äôs no man in the family, I‚Äôve to constantly work and make sure that my children live a much better life. Somehow I managed to marry my two daughters, they are quite busy in their lives now. I often think of moving back to Odisha, but then there‚Äôs neither a home nor a work there. Due to circumstances I had to leave my elder son, Jeetu back in the village. He just got admission in ninth grade and then the lockdown happened. I want to bring him back as soon as possible

Satpura Night Mess
Pratyush Pandey
Jun 26, 2020
2 min read
I was in the Hotel Industry before coming to IIT. I‚Äôm a native of Uttarakhand. I have been working in IIT for the past 3 years, and it has been a good experience. I came to the institute in 2016 when I was looking for new work. I got information that there is an empty canteen in IIT, and being in the hotel line I can serve good food. So I thought, why not, let‚Äôs try in IIT. I talked to the warden and trialled my food, and the kids really really liked it! So I immediately came here and started working. Thankfully the reviews for my food have been consistently good.
After I completed my class 12, I did my SM (equivalent of BA) in Uttarakhand. After that I got a degree in Hotel Management, and then I took some job training and worked a job. I went to Rudrapura at first. Then from there I went to Goa, then onwards to Himachal. After that I found myself working in Turkey! After my stint in Turkey I came here.
Here all my interactions with the kids and the administration has been very good.
As for my family, I still have my parents who live in Dehradun. We are three brothers, and all of us live and work in Delhi. I‚Äôm married for two years, and don‚Äôt have any children yet.
The experience during coronavirus was very bad. The shop in IIT was essential for running my home. Then some money came from IIT, and that gave a lot of relief. It felt very nice that IIT thought of us in these tough times, they were a lot of help. In our village in Uttarakhand, we don‚Äôt have a lot of cases but still we are observing every precaution. Social distancing is the norm; we are not coming together in any large gatherings or anything.
Manoj Bisht,
"Night Mess waale Bhaiyya",

Stuck in IIT
Pratyush Pandey
May 19, 2020

Andrien is majoring in Energy Studies at the City University of Hong Kong. He is an exchange student in India and has been staying in Kumaon for the past 2 months, during lockdown, alone.
- - - - - - -
I made a lot of friends at IIT since I‚Äôve been here. We went to Kasol, and then Jodhpur and even squeezed in a Goa trip with my german friends after Minor 2 was canceled.
That night, we had a party in Kumaon, and I was sure all of them would be back in 2 weeks.
When I came back from Goa my german friends left India. I stayed because, for one, I knew what a strict place IIT was and I knew they would restart classes no matter what.
The students here had really shocked me when I first came here. Back home, the classrooms are usually completely dark with most students doing their own thing. At IIT, students have to actually focus. Some professors here, I know they speak English but I couldn‚Äôt understand them and even if I try to use google translate on my phone, they would say ‚ÄòHey, stop using your phone‚Äô
Since the lockdown, every day seemed the same. Far from the exciting India trip, I had envisioned. My friends and I kept talking to each other and planning our next party in Kumaon so as to not get so depressed.
There are around 15 people with me - some local students, Afghanistani students, and some from Africa. Food is the usual although sometimes I order Zomato so I can eat something nice. My friends in Hong Kong joke about me never being able to come back. They tell me to stay in India and get citizenship and marry a girl!
My family is safe and life has resumed in Hong Kong, which is why I can‚Äôt understand why the corona cases in India keep blowing up even with a lockdown. But even with everything that happened this year, my time in India has changed my life. It‚Äôs also changed my attitude towards learning. I try to do something new every day now. I started learning Photoshop and Korean on youtube. My Kumaon friends, we kept planning about when we will meet again and party. That got me so excited and I kept hoping it would happen. I‚Äôll be going home now and I won‚Äôt come back, and it‚Äôs just sad I will not be able to meet my friends again.

Timble wale Sir
Pratyush Pandey
Mar 11, 2020
2 min read
"Timble waale sir", as he‚Äôs lovingly *ahem* called by the student population here, is someone you would want to see only when you‚Äôre sitting at 74% attendance and see no way out of your seemingly inevitable grade down.
Abhishek Sharma is the face of Timble here at IIT Delhi. A loving husband and a doting father, he has been working in IIT Delhi since July 2017. He has been acquainted with IIT much longer than that though.
‚ÄúBefore starting at IIT, I had a job in Katwaria, involving testing. I used to come to the IIT grounds for my morning walk daily and couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if and when I would have the chance to be here someday. Following a fortuitous meeting with a stranger, aided by a stroke of luck, I found a job here in Timble support.
I was somewhat apprehensive before coming to IIT, afraid of whether I‚Äôll be able to reach the students here. I felt so shy in front of these smart people. But the students here are really nice and have always made me feel like a part of IIT, far from the distant personas people generally think of. They don‚Äôt seem like strangers, more like people I have been acquaintances with long before.‚Äù Continuing, when asked about some of the challenges he has to face:
‚ÄúI have to travel around 75km when travelling from home to work but I like to think it instils the values of routine and respecting time in me. Also, it is no news that many students try to increase their attendance by raising false queries making life busy, just because of the sheer numbers, but now we are advanced enough to segregate false and true requests fairly quickly. One way to solve this to an extent is to relax attendance for better-performing students as others need to attend classes more than them, in my opinion.‚Äù Finally what he takes away from IIT:
‚ÄúIf nothing else, one thing IIT has taught me the most is the importance of education. I just want to be able to provide for the best education my daughter can have. And with all the interaction, food, people and memories in a safe environment where I feel like I am at ease, IIT is ‚Ä¶ home.‚Äù - Abhishek Sharma, "Timble Waale Sir"
(Interviewed by Ishita Hans and Shauryasikt Jena)

Himadri Guard
Pratyush Pandey
Mar 8, 2020
2 min read
‚ÄúMy father was a soldier, a fauji. Till date, I wonder why he always slept on a flat gadda. But that‚Äôs why I consider myself to be a fauji like him too - even in school, I was the class monitor! Perhaps, that‚Äôs why my fate led me to a guard‚Äôs job.‚Äù said Mrs Bhagwati as she offered me a seat near the heater, and began with her adventurous life story.
She had a shop nearby, and her search for a part-time job at night led her to IIT. She went on, ‚ÄúMy story is very interesting, because of my faith in God. I came to IITs main gate in the evening and asked the guards if they knew where the security control room was. They made me sit at the main gate and told me to call my person of contact there. After waiting for a while and a brief interrogation from the guard, I told him about my search for a job, to which he said, ‚ÄúGo to Ranjan sir in the Control room and tell him that Sanjay sir has sent you, and be as confident as possible‚Äù. So, I talked to Ranjan sir - mentioning very proudly that I‚Äôm a soldier‚Äôs daughter - and they told me that Sanjay would be notified of my selection. Now, I had no clue who this Sanjay sir was, but the next morning I went anyway and I think I aced the interview and rushed back to work. While I was going back to work, near Bharti Building a man crossed over the road and suddenly asked me, ‚ÄúAre you the woman from Katwaria who used my name to get an interview with the control room?‚Äù. I was quite startled but happy to finally meet Sanjay. I apologized and thankfully, he was very kind about it! Since then, I‚Äôve loved being a guard. The respect I get inside IIT doesn‚Äôt make me want to leave. At the start, my in-laws told me that working as a guard is futile - you can focus on increasing the business of the shop, that will pay more but I don‚Äôt do this job purely for money.‚Äù A moment later, she asked me if she can add something for all the women, and said, ‚ÄúI just want to take this moment to say to every woman that please be careful when you‚Äôre thinking of marrying someone. Don‚Äôt give up your property, your wealth, and most of all - please don‚Äôt give up your fierce independence just for a man.‚Äù - Bhagwati, Himadri night guard

Keshav Bhaiya
Pratyush Pandey
Feb 28, 2020
1 min read
Hailing from Mathura, Keshav bhaiya came to IIT through family recommendations and has been with us for over 4 years. Officially the groundsman at the sports office seldom lets his assigned responsibilities limit his contribution to sports at IIT Delhi as he juggles responsibilities helping students and staff with their clerical and other administrative sports problems. Recognized as one of the most versatile and hardest working employees, he hasn't let his personal lack of sporting abilities affect his enthusiasm for fostering a better sports culture at IIT Delhi.
To no one's surprise, Keshav bhaiya is the popular guy of the office liked and adored by his colleagues.
Even the workaholic Keshav bhaiya cites lunch with his friends the favorite part of his day. Throughout his time in IIT, he says his experience with colleagues and seniors has been amazing, particularly, he's grateful for their belief in him, and the opportunities afforded for him.
May Keshav Bhaiya make everyone's life happier, and be the glue which holds the sports office together.

Cyclewale Bhaiya
Pratyush Pandey
Oct 1, 2019
2 min read
Ramashray Bhaiya is one of the 17 heavenly creatures you seek when you're dashing headlong for your 8:00 a.m classes.
After a very strenuous morning, he's massaging his knees and waiting for his battery rickshaw to be fully charged when we meet him. Ramashray Bhaiya greets us with a broad smile as we begin with our spree of questions.
.
"How did you end up at IIT Delhi ?"
.
He starts with contentment, "I hail from a very decent family in Unnao, my brother is the pradhan of a village, he told me about this project being started at IIT. Sumitri Saheb started it, as far as I remember. Saheb told us that our job is permanent, so I agreed. And it's been 19 years since then, in the service of students." Ramashray Bhaiya wipes his forehead as he speaks.
Sun glares at us with even greater vigour.
.
When we start about his family and his life, the content in his voice gave away to forlornness, and he continues,
.
"I live in Katwaria Sarai. My family is settled in the village, and I can't afford to keep them with me in a meagre earning of 9000 per month. It's hard to cook alone for yourself every day but can't help it.
I realised the due importance of education when I came to IIT and put my children in a school. I even enrolled my daughter in coaching for some exam I don't remember now.
‡§≤‡§°‡§º‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡§¢‡§º‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§®‡•å‡§ï‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§≤‡§ó ‡§™‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Ä, ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§ò‡•Ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ‡§Å ‡§∏‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡•á ‡§Ö‡§´‡§∏‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã. "
The pain in his last words is quite apparent, and in a very subtle way he adds,
"I feel that IIT has been good with us, but somewhere along the line, we have been neglected.
We run on the same rates as of 2013, we didn't get sufficient e-rickshaws after several promises, neither do the authorities pay heed to us when we voice our concerns, may it be the rates or some random auto-rickshaw, cutting our daily income to an even greater extent. I can't opt for a different job at this age, my knees have given up after 19 years of toil."
.
Ramashray Bhaiya stands up, like a saviour who has been fighting hard for a better life.
.
"One last thing, what keeps you here despite such problems?"
.
"‡§Ø‡§π‡§æ‡§Å ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á. ‡§µ‡•ã ‡§π‡§Æ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡•à‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§π‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§â‡§®‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡•à‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§π‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç "
‚Ä¢
And he walks away.
(Due to personal concerns, Bhaiya asked us not to put up his picture online. We respect that.)

Nescafe Bhaiya
Pratyush Pandey
Sep 18, 2019
2 min read
People often forget that just like students, there also exists another group of people that step into a new part of their life after coming to IIT. Mr Kailash Choudhary, having roots from Bihar but born and raised in Delhi, started a new phase of his life here at IIT Delhi seven years ago. Mr Kailash works at Nescafe during the night hours, and students who usually study late in the library are sure to have met him.
He works from 6 pm - 5 am everyday, due to which he has to take time during the day to sleep. This makes his job harder than it looks, as such a strange work schedule makes it difficult for him to try new things or give time for his hobbies. Still, he seems to love his job here at IIT. When asked for a reason, his reply was simple - ‚ÄúRespect‚Äù. ‚ÄúStudents here at IIT Delhi have a habit of talking to everyone with respect. For example, Guard Sahab‚Äù. He sells around 50 brownies, 150 muffins and 400 to 500 cups of coffee a day. Apart from work, he really loves playing cricket and is a fan of Sachin.
When asked about an incident here at IIT Delhi that he‚Äôd never forgotten, he shared a quite humorous event he had. He said, ‚ÄúI was working both shifts during that time, day job at someplace else and night job here at Nescafe. I hadn‚Äôt slept for 24 hours straight and was really exhausted, so it was around 1:00 a.m when I dozed off, my partner went to the restroom for a while when a girl came to buy something while I was sleeping. She tried to wake me up and thinking that it was my partner who was doing that, I blabbered some stuff while being half asleep. I later realized that it was a customer and had to apologize. She thought that I was drunk.‚Äù The next time you are at or around Nescafe when he‚Äôs working, take a moment to go chat with him, for his best stories are also the ones we cant write

Amul Bhaiya
Pratyush Pandey
Sep 14, 2019
2 min read
"I completed my intermediate and took admission in B.A. soon afterwards. The village didn't give enough opportunities to make the ends meet, and income generated from farming was also insufficient. Owing to the financial crunch, I dropped out of B.A. and came to Chandigarh where I worked for an year in the manufacturing sector. Later, I came to Delhi to work with the help of my relatives. My father in law's friend, who lived in the same locality, happened to be the owner of Amul Shop, and he offered me a job here.
Initially, when I came to Delhi I was very scared of the traffic jams and huge crowds. I still recall an incident when I walked through the roads with my bags over my head to meet my wife because I couldn't bear the traffic jam in the way. One fond memory which I still cherish is my visit to the zoo in Delhi when I was in 9th Class. I still remember a monkey who made unique gestures with an unusual voice.
IIT Delhi has been a wonderful experience so far, among all the items we sell Pizza Kulcha is the one I like the most. It's also the most sold product besides tea, of course, of which we sell around 600-700 cups a day. I have a shift of 12 hours in general, but I prefer a continuous 24-hour shift so that we can relax the next full day. We take breaks while working so it becomes easier to work for that long.
Most of the free time I get is spent in playing with and teaching my small children who are in playgroup. It's been two and a half years since I started working at IIT Delhi, and students and professors remain our usual customers; it's always good to see them leave satisfied with our shop."

Kamla Aunty
Pratyush Pandey

"Bad times are a part of life. They come and go. The important thing is to stay happy with what you have." This is the philosophy that Kamla Aunty, who runs the tiny tea stall stacked behind the SBI outlet follows. Most of the students and professors stroll right past it, bustling in and out of LHC.
She lives in Gurugram and travels every day to open her shop at 9.30 AM. For many bank employees, it is their day's first cup of tea. Its a place for students to go after their classes get finished. "I opened the shop back in 1998, and I haven't changed a thing about it yet. My husband used to work at this bank before that. While he is no more, I like this place and the people here. I have a lot of people coming in every day. Usually, I cant keep track of how many batches of tea I've brewed, but I usually always remember the faces." It's supposed to be a bank canteen, but no one can stop the stream of students and professors frequenting the shack.
When we approached her, she seemed very hesitant. She served tea to half a dozen or so people and bustled out with her phone pressed to her ear. She returned after talking to her son, content that it was okay to speak to us.
Her tea was as sweet as her personality. "IIT ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§Ø‡§π‡§æ‡§Å ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç|"

Pratyush Pandey

I still remember taking up the book 'Franny and Zooey' by JD Salinger as a 17 year old. A reason why this book resonated with me so much is that it proliferated a strong message - that everything we do is self-serving and self-centred to an extent - even in the most minute ways. Over the years, I have wasted hours trying to convince myself otherwise, but to no avail. This search ended when I met Mr Alag Natarajan, a 60-year-old citizen of Panchsheel Park, Delhi, who is indeed living up to his name, 'alag'. Those of you who might have come across his social service endeavours will know him as 'Matkaman'.
Before his work, let's get to know the man first. Mr Alag Natarajan was a passionate engineer since his childhood. He was capable of fixing an automobile engine before he cleared high school. This passion, clubbed with the inspiration from his father to give something back to the community, served as a drastic turning point later in his life. He joined Ramaiyyah college, Bangalore as a mechanical engineering student, but dropped out to move to London and start his own business. The business took off, and he returned to India nearing his retirement and settled here.
Let's cut to the present day. Mr Alag starts his day at 4 AM in the morning. He fills the tanks of his custom made van with potable water with the help of a pump assembly. He packs eggs and winter clothes and sets off to multiple locations where his 'matkas' are installed. ‚ÄúI started this in a smaller way two years ago by placing a couple of pots on a stand in front of my residence in Panchsheel Park. I noticed a lot of passers-by, especially construction workers and cyclists, going to distant areas for work, stopping to drink water. Also, auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers would not only drink water but also fill their bottles.‚Äù
Sensing that it was not enough, Natarajan decided to expand the idea to neighbouring colonies including Green Park, Hauz Khas and Chirag Delhi. But that not only required installing more Matka stands but also the paraphernalia to fill them. Soon, his efforts diversified to giving eggs to feed the poor and giving them warm clothes to help them bear the chilling Delhi winter. As his efforts diversified, so did his van, and he had to import some parts from the USA to sustain his mission. Today, his van is fitted with a high capacity pump to fill the matkas quickly and efficient, a large plastic tank and a heater generator arrangement to help boil the eggs and feed the poor. Of course, sustaining this effort required a good amount of financial commitment as well, and not backed by any NGO, and set on his journey to try and bring about the change he represents, he is using his life savings for his purpose. He stated on multiple occasions how thankful he is for his supportive wife. ‚ÄúMy household help and his wife are my support pillars. That apart, our household help and gardener also assists with much of the work,‚Äù he adds.
It has gotten to the point where his efforts have led to him making sacrifices in his own standards of living to sustain and upscale his efforts. "I've had my days of living in the fast lane. I used to be the guy driving the expensive car. Now just last month, me and my wife, we wanted to get us a new car, nothing too fancy. But the thought of spending 15 lakhs to get a new car when it means warmer clothes, nice breakfast to someone poor suffering in Delhi cold was too much. I just couldn't bring myself to do it." He adds how this has engulfed some other aspects of his life as well, and he has simplified his life such that from the clothes he wears to the coffee he drinks, nothing is branded. Which raises the fundamental question - how much does a man need to sustain himself? Something he owes to 'vipassana' for teaching him.
Before he started on this path, a wise person once told him, "The path to righteousness, from the background that you belong to, won't be easy. The people won't understand, and you will expose their hypocrisy." His neighbours objected to his installations of water coolers and benches for the poor, saying it might lead to drunkards and trouble makers coming into the area. They fenced their colony from the footpath connecting it to the main road to keep passerby from coming in. "Why should ordinary people be kept from drinking water due to concerns about trouble makers? Do people who drink not need water?" he grew emotional as he went on. "I cut the fence open with some help. They called the police and got it closed. I opened it again, this time with my own hands. Thankfully it's been that way for three months."
"People, in their endless pursuit of greed, have lost the ability to touch human lives. Some of my neighbours, who see me filling water in my van in the morning or cutting vegetables to cook for the poor in front of my house never do so much as buy a woollen sock for me to distribute among the poor. The man living next door just bought a brand new Porsche, and he has never done so much as donating a penny for my efforts." he continues - " When people ask me what they can do to help out, the answer is very simple. Give me a dozen eggs. Buy me clothes or vegetables. Go and fill my matkas. Charity begins when one opens one's own pocket for the service of the poor." Stressing that he wished for Panchsheel Park to be an example for future India and how we should treat our poor. "The colony watchmen, from other houses came to thank me once, telling me how they benefited front my coolers ‚Äî saying how the home owners won't even give them water to drink. I once came across two children outside my house. One was trying to pull a light I had installed on my wall. The other immediately reprimanded him, saying the owner is good, he gives us water and food, so why are you doing this? If I am good to the people, they will never wrong me.
The cynic in me wanted to believe that there was some selfish motif behind this action, but I was quickly proven wrong. Mr Natarajan clarifies early on that he wasn't doing this work for societal validation or even inner satisfaction or happiness. He wanted to work for the sake of working, serve for the sake of serving. His wife took over here and narrated a very simple incident when he saw a person who delivered ice in the scorching Delhi heat on a cycle. He had to hurry so that the ice didn't melt. After observing his routine, Mr Alag called the man, a total stranger, and took him to a bike dealership. Before the man could understand what was happening, he purchased a bike, fitted a basket on it to carry the ice, and handed him the keys. "The guy fell on his feet, but it wouldn't have made any difference if he didn't. Alag had done his duty, and he would have walked away contended in this fact."
In an effort to know more about the person, and seek answers to some of the questions I had been asking, I decided to interview his close friends and relatives. Some very useful insights came out. For one, Mr alag suffered from cancer while he was in the UK. After fighting it for a few years and almost coming face to face with death, he came back to India and started working with the American Foundation in Varanasi to make the manual rickshaws more efficient. Then he volunteered in Delhi itself in terminal cancer hospitals as a part of an NGO. There were some bodies which no one claimed at that place, so he brought a van to carry these people to the cemetery and give them a proper burial. And this is the same Van he uses, to this day, to help the poor. However, his efforts caught the eye of the NGO leaders, who grew insecure about their position in light of his efforts. Soon it became difficult for him to continue working there, so he decided to leave and start his own independent efforts to make a difference. He doesn't want to be called an NGO, or an organisation of any kind. Its always been him - well, him, his family, and his dog, Snoopy. And the rest is what it is.
To conclude, it's hard to believe people like him exist in today's A-grade colonies, with such pure motivations to serve. People who put others first unconditionally. Another quote by Salinger comes to mind - "Introduce me to the egoless human, and I will be his or her unabashed servant till the end of time." So the next time you are in Panchsheel Park, make sure you pay his house a visit. Any watchman or pedestrian will tell you the way. You will find the 'matkaman' sitting on his porch, ever ready for tea and amazing conversations, and his dog Snoopy, right by his side, ever ready to play fetch.
